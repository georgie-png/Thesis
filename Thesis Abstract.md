# Crip and Queer Methods towards Infrastructural Coalition

This thesis brings together my First Person Disobedient Action Research inquiry into crip and queer infrastructural coalition. It weaves together a number of different inquiries and collaborations to surface how I have decided to disobediently turn from generalised logics of automation towards community manifestings of infrastructures. Through a crip crazed manifestos/ings and embodied interdependence, I disorient these practices that aim to (con)figuring out these digital network infrastructures locally.

To do this I construct a framework with Sarah Ahmed and Alison Kafer's work to question how I could start to draw disobedient queer and crip lines towards sociotechnical infrastructures. I focus on how we can orient together towards other paths through generativley flawed and crazy Crip and Queer manifestings. The research then goes through then actioning these manifestings in inquiries. These focus on forming a crip reading of the background of this research, a turn to crip configure-able methods through critical access, and then two inquiries into these methods in practice. The first internationally with In-grid, a Trans\*Feminist collective I help organise, inquiring into our collective development of collective network (con)figuring out practices. The second focuses on initiating the Cozy-Cloud, a crip server, and starting to form coalitions with people and network infrastructures through crip politics, intimacies, affirmation and embodied practices. 

These inquiries as I say weave together different baskets, contexts and improvisations of these methods to localise and feel how they manifest in indeterminate ways. In many ways this research is just the start of this work, but sets a new (back)ground and foundation for more Crip and Queer futures to be manifested and (con)figured out from now!

Through this thesis's disobedient inquiry I have been weaving together different baskets, contexts and improvisations for these methods to localise and surface how they themselves manifest in indeterminate ways. This disobedience 
away from curative efficient automation and towards coalitions of cripped sociotechnical practices it manifests songs and tales to disorient the line and challenge the "norms" of infrastructures now!
