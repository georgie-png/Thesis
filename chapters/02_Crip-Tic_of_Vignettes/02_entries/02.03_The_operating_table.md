In this section, I will reflect on how the efficiencies of care institutes and health systems leave Crip people on edge waiting for minimal care at any unknown (or unknowable) point. Specifically in my context of the UK National Health Service (NHS), as well as other benefit and care systems that have been heavily underfunded through "austerity" politics we can turn to the work of China Mills (2018; Mills & Pring, 2024) to see how the health system has a direct effect on the mental wellbeing and possibility of disabled life under these violent times, policies and politics. Here I will bring into focus my own embodied experiences of these relations, and how they made sense to me as a crip researcher.

Here, I could talk for ages about the subtleties and changes in how my injected medicine is scheduled for delivery around the hard efficiencies of the system and not my capacities. Similarly I could turn to how Laura Forlano rubs up against and hacks her medical devices and relations (2023; 2016). I could discuss how I am a cyborg modified with biologics, and connected to a refrigerated delivery pipeline. How this has slowly changed without my input from a relation where the default was a call from a caring person, who would help to guide and talk through the process of arranging your delivery through to the current efficient appified model, that pings, pokes and "reminds" you to go through some fiddly forms, which you may not be in a good place to respond to. These sets of relations are complex and situated though, and some people may find this sort of automation frees them up to have more agency over their care, whereas others may find this system cannot care for their needs as it is too generalised.

What I want to rub up against here is the neo-liberal catchy rhetoric around ethical automation. I heard the likes of "a human in the system" at a UKRI *social science conferences*, and which through a few words aims to cure the inabilities of automated systems to care. The irony is that there is always "a person" within a system if not many, some trying to approach it, some developing and orienting it, as well as the many maintaining it, but all of these positions and more seem to be ignored. By their definition they aim to cure the inabilities of the system by throwing another person in the middle, and this generalised five word slogan cannot specify where they are or what they are doing. You could throw in 100 more people, but if we do not care about how, where or what stuff they are doing, we could be doing them and the people, things and relations they are trying to "care for" as much damage as if they were not there. This next section gives a more precise encounter of automation without affirmation that I experienced in my chronic care. The lack of intimacy in this encounter highlights why the work of imagining and orienting towards affirmative infrastructure is so essential.

In this section I will recount a recent experience of institutionalised "care" that left me with more violent damage to my body than it benefited my well-being. This began when I had my third major flare up of my life. This resulted mainly from being a crip person forced to work over full-time to financially survive when I only have the ability to work part-time. This relational fallout was due to unstable terms, non-existent support networks, both institutional and familial, and the invalidating exhaustive expectations of normative social roles. I have already touched on these causalities and eddies in earlier sections, so here I will orienting more around how in the aftermath of these relations, and when in search of care, it became a struggle to have my needs acknowledge let alone cared for. This reflection is also not meant as a individual tale of a singular crip's treatment, but a place to expand and fabulate from, especially in the UK. It is where I make room and time for us to imagine the industrial scales that the political/relations of institutional care tables operate through.

When trying to reach out for help it first has to be noted that I was in the cracks of a system. I was between hospitals, not only due to having moved locations, but also due to me running away from similar mistreatment in my prior specialist department. This left me between pipelines of care and treading water to stay afloat as I flared up with no support beyond taking sick leave and time off of one of my four jobs I had at that time. When reaching out for a referral to my local hospital in Plymouth, both my GP and my previous carers both pointed the finger at each other to initiate this change. After a while I pushed the GP to initiate this move as I did want to get in touch or engage with my old department. They put me through as a standard referral, even though I was badly flared. After a month or two of "self care" I finally received a referral letter with no date on it, but telling me to check my contact details, ready for when they would contact me and a date would be given. I decided this was not good enough and pushed the GP to increase my urgency on the referral. In response he said that this was unlikely to do anything and tried to convince me not to do it. In response to this I told him that I was very much living in a reality where these things felt unlikely to change and I just needed him to try and see what would happen. After this strong defending of my needs he agreed to raise the importance of the referral. "Against all the odds" this resulted in me getting a call to book in an appointment one week later with my new specialist. In the virtual call with this specialist, he very calmly tried to quell my anxieties by offering me multiple examinations, from a low intrusive MRI, through to an intrusive colonoscopy, both to find out what the "problem" is. At the time this did comfort me somewhat but it became obvious that these were just words and none of the care would be non-intrusive.

After this meeting I waited a few weeks, and eventually a letter came through the post of another non-dated referral for a colonoscopy. This time though it came with an enema kit, labelled, "cleen, ready-to-use" (+@fig:cleen). When I opened it up, I wondered how long, if ever, it would take for me to be given an appointment. The only thing I knew was that when the call came I had to empty my bowls ready for them to violate my body to acquire the data that would validate my pain, and the needs that I had already informed them of verbally.

A few weeks later, somewhat fortunately, and somewhat stressfully, I received another letter and call from the appointments team informing me that I had been given a slot in just under two weeks' time. Time shifted from an eternity into immediacy, taking me off balance as I was not prepared to experience the same treatment that had left me traumatised years before. The department's preparation for this appointment was again a virtual telephone appointment with a nurse to do the pre-assessment. In this call I tried to vouch for the type of care that I wanted, asking to be sedated as I knew this was a painful experience for me, and expressing that I had been previous difficulties with this procedure. In response the nurse only played down my fears and told me that it would not be as bad as I thought, and encouraged me not to be sedated for the procedure, and just to take gas and air to alleviate minor pain. I still tried to vouch for myself but ended up in a middle ground of trying gas and air, to then turn to sedation if I felt it was too much during the procedure. The thing I find extraordinary, beyond the playing down of my fears, is that when I expressed previous traumatic experiences in this area, they did not think to provide extra care for this, in the forms of providing sedation, nor mental health support going into it. They also did not ask for more information around what happened and how to care for it. Fortunately, I have the capacity to afford a private therapist that I have been seeing for a while and they squeezed me in last minute, and coached me through the upcoming treatment. It would have been very hard without this extra time and care. These extra times though were too much for the institutions of care to afford, and realistically had always been since the start of my disability 7 years prior. This denial of more time to care when we table sensitive bodies and relations in time is a denial and invalidation of the affirmative types of care that these institutions and their efficient capital configurations could hold if configured otherwise.

When it came to the day of the procedure, I was lucky enough to have a support network that meant that it was possible for me to be sedated if I needed to be. If I was isolated, like many disabled people are, and without this support system of people to look after me for twenty four hours after the procedure, I would have had to forfeit sedation, as again the institution would not have the time to hold me. As I went in with my friend, we were early to be checked in, so hanging around awkwardly in the corridors of the hospital. When we finally went in to register me, I went to the desk of the department, where I was greeted by, as I guessed by their voice and demeanour, the nurse with whom I had had the phone pre-assessment. Again this interaction seemed to play down my fears and experiences, and pushed me to be squeezed and misfitted into the efficient configures slot of their normative care of gas and air and not be sedated as I had repeatedly asked. After this I waited with my friend, and after 30 minutes I was ushered into another pre-assessment room, where I was quantified, by weight, height and blood pressure, and then left to wait again but by myself.

After sitting there for what felt like an eternity, with many thoughts running through my mind, and anxieties growing, I started to question and think about how to again try and advocate for the type of care that would affirm me here. I took small steps to test the waters and capacitiy for wiggle room within what felt like a very hard system. Initially I started by just asking to go to the toilet, which I had not been told where or if I could use. After this small success I had started to build up the momentum to feel like I was able to vouch for the type of care that I really needed. I was eventually taken through to the operating table, where I was briefly introduced to the two men operating on me who I had never met before, nor had a virtual call with. They went on to lay me down and prepare me for the operation, it's hard to remember but it initially felt like my desires to be sedated had not made it through. It was only when I stated the word "traumatising" in relation to my prior experiences that his eyes lit up, and he started to take me seriously. It is hard to say here whether that was in relation to providing me with the appropriate care for my situation, or whether it was that by stating these words I had gained leverage by holding him accountable to his actions.

I still for some reason felt obliged to try and be shoehorned into the efficient slot of non-sedation, and have the sedation as a backup, something I will not do again. To prepare for this he went to put an IV in my left arm. After having my blood taken many times, every three months for the last 7 years, I am used to the pain and know what to expect, and also get complimented on how easy my veins are to find. As he slipped in, I felt more pain than normal, a sharp sting that I flinched at; as he tried to draw blood it worsened and so did my reaction. Disregarding my response and feelings and after a few more painful attempts to get it to flow he pulled out, telling me that I had not stayed in-line with his needle. I began to cry, feeling no trust in this person, or in how they were about to operate on me. I lay there still. Without a glance he moved to the other arm, and proceeded to try again. This time I was internally trying to stay in-line as much as possible as he slid inside of me. This time it felt the same as any other, and this time I did not flinch.

This is also the time that I passed out, not that time at that table, but the time just after writing the last paragraph at this table. Twenty four hours later, writing this having again been treated by the NHS, this time for passing out, for falling from a counter chair, and for hitting my head on the ground. All because I dare to remember that time. I think it's safe to say that I will not be writing about that time, but I can tell you worlds collapsed, sedation through party drugs doubled by bodily violation and immense pain brought memories, spaces and feelings in-line and out of time. I blacked out from pain and I awoke still crying.

Waking up on the floor after passing out remembering this, this time. I was assisted by the staff of the coffee shop. They helped me sit up, drink up and come to. They did, however, immediately get me to sign an accident waiver form to make sure that they would be covered around this individual "problem". They asked why it happened, I could not say. I texted my friend, and she said she was on her way. When I was doing better I gently walked home, around the corner, where she met me. I felt obliged by norms of rational care to call up 111, the low emergency support number in the UK. I felt okay, and had no clear signs of concussion, but the rationale of their care insisted I go back to the hospital, the same hospital I had remembered. They told me it was urgent, so I should pay for a taxi, but not important enough to send an ambulance, but they would be waiting and ready to receive me. I went in again, they did not know who I was and were not ready for me, sitting there like human livestock, watching people go mad around me in these sick times. I was quantified, I had my vitals taken after a few hours, but nothing said to me, just that it wouldn't be so bad. I waited another few hours with nothing said to me. I finally asked what was going on, they told me I had another 3-4 hours left to be seen. A senior doctor, not in the conversation and with his back to me looked over his shoulder said, "you should probably go home". I asked, "do you know why I am here?" He did not, even though I had told four people why I had passed out, because I had remembered. Their table of operations could not hold this information. They told me "that I had decided to come here", and so "it was on me". I told them "111 had told me to be there", so I felt like I had to go here, if it was up to me, I would have stayed home from the beginning. They didn't reply, I took a complaints number and left. I still haven't complained because I am not sure what it will do.

As I woke up after the last time, crying, in came the "specialist" who had done this to me. He told me how my body was, he told me that I was having fast movements, when they were actually very slow, and told me to take medicine to slow me down further. I refused. He told me that I wasn't so inflamed, I told him it had been months since I was, so was starting to settle after my own care. He told me that when you focus on sensing something too much it can start to hurt more than if you ignore it. I had just stopped heavily dissociating from my body that year, and focusing on my body and feelings was helping me to get stable. He tried to get me to take more biological and immunosuppressant medicines as a quick fix. I refused and vouched for the type of care that I wanted: mental, dietary and financial. He looked confused. He then started to prescribe me dietary advice whilst I was still reeling in pain and confusion from this experience, not in a way where it was helpful, but in a way where he reinforced his expertise and role as a "specialist". He left, my friend picked me up, with another giving me a lift home.

On my own Crip timeline of writing this thesis, it took me a month just to start writing again since being on the operating table, as I could not find the words. No one in those institutions and from that time called me up for aftercare. My bodymind was much worse off after being treated by them and it has taken many more than months to heal it still. These treatments, these performances of efficient industrial care and this experience have still not benefited me in any way so far, just left more scars on my bodymind. I again stepped out from this public institution and into private care, in the form of paying for myself to have a dietitian and try to improve things. This time, I think because I had paid for it, I had someone's time and this time they listened and cared. Over this time, I started to get better again.

The "specialist" who had done this to me, had, however listened somewhat and gotten me a dietitian from the NHS. This appointment was more disorienting than helpful though. Even though I had been making progress, been gaining weight, been feeling better in my body, they told me that I should stop what I was doing and have a normal diet. That I should just be normal, otherwise I might be doing damage to my own bodymind, and that the feelings and practices I had grown in relation to my expertise where not okay. They didn't give me any advice on how to become "normal", just that I should be, and that I should also start eating things that I knew were painful to eat. They also told me I should get on more medication as a quick fix, even though I am not sure they were qualified to recommend this. Quite inappropriately they were also the one to tell me the results that came back from my operation, and that I was still inflamed, even though he had told me I wasn't when I awoke. This was over a month later and no one had reached out to tell me this before. They also told me I had a different condition to what I had been diagnosed with before. I left disenfranchised, disoriented and dissociating.

I later had another appointment with my "specialist" as a follow up a month or two later than the dietitian. I arrived on time, the appointment was delayed. I waited an hour and a half. He finally made time for me. I went in, and he was already high energy, it was hard for me to orient around this anxious energy. I asked if I could record the meeting to listen back and chat about it with my sister. He said no and started saying I was trying to post him online, and set him up, I was not trying to do this. We ended up getting a nurse to help mediate the conversation. It carried on with this type of dynamic for the entire appointment, with him taking an hour to even "remember", acknowledge, and validate what happened in my last operation by him. Continually after this point he tried to make me feel bad for taking more time than my appointment allocated, of needing too much, and trying to shake me off this table. When we finally got past him acknowledging the operation happened we finally turned to future care for me, where he still told me I had a different condition to what I had been told all along. I contested this, but he said he knew, even though he did not have the files from my old hospital, as they had not been transferred. In a later meeting with my specialist nurse, which was actually the first close to affirmative appointment I had, she finally acknowledged that I had the condition I knew I had, and proven through the data my "specialist" had misread. She also noted that some of the medication that he had suggested would not have helped, was inappropriate and may have made things worse. The thing I found profound, and which is a sedimented critique of the medical model and pharma-capitol is his normalised move to prescribe very expensive, high side effect, and restraining medication, rather than provide social relational care for me. Instead of listening from the beginning where I asked for a dietitian, a therapist and some space to reorient my bodymind and which cost roughly the same if not less that the medication he wanted to prescribe, this "data" was invalidated, to instead go on a deep and violent exploration to the truth of the problem, which I already knew . . . was in the system.

I don't recount this as a sympathy plea, as to say that I am the one suffering, or to recourse revenge on the problematic people in these systems, but to make room on this table for this stuff. Compared to other disabled people under the current economic system, I am a relatively financially stable person, and if you know me you know I am also very able and willing to defend my boundaries. I am also white and often perceived as a man by these institutions, which is frustrating, but all these things will orient the type of care I receive. This is one incident in my own life, and sits here as a frictious contour, a misfitting of needs, and a cliff to look over the bodily horizon of these institutions of care. It is to to make room to bring in the background of disability the norms of the institutions invalidate and ignore. Not as a matter of fact, but a fact that matters, and matters more when we fabulate to hold the many stories of people within this industrial grinding down of care. Ones which are much worse than this. Sitting in the A&E for 5 hours was enough to see these lives, these times, and these bodyminds being driven mad and made sick in the presence of institutional care. This institution is not meant to hold all of these lives, experiences and pain, as it was never imagined to. This recollection of the operating table is here to wedge open the door from slamming shut and let these feelings spill through into dialogues of affirmative infrastructures. How can these Crip experiences, practices and wisdoms around institutions, around just refusal and self-advocacy, be in relation to those that wish to operate on us? How can they inform critiques of the current configurations of care and imagine the times, spaces and futures we really need? When I say really need, I mean really need.
