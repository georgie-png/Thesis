## The crip table

Here is in many ways where I start to turn away from these other tables I have been institutionally forced to be in touch with and instead turn to the crip table that this research orients towards. This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their *Rest Assured* workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar *Life Affirming Organisational Practices* (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.

M.E.L.T.'s *Rest Assured* workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as "an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's *Artist in president* talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.

Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called *Life Affirming Organisational Practices*. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.

The *Life Affirming Organisational Practices* event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde[^q5], where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.

The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's *Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance* workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that "broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure.

[^q5]: "Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one's own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge." - (Lorde, 1997, p. 282)
