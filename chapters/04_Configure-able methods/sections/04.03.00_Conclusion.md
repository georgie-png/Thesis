## Conclusion

This chapter in the thesis, is meant to hold an internal arc or inflection that disorients both this researchers path and their use of configuration as method. It inflects this research from inquiring into the dialogues of centralised plans to instead orient toward  interdependent practices of configuring life affirming infrastructures from site of impact. Through forming a genealogy of configuration, and then inflecting it with a crip -able, I aim to have set a new background to configure out the rest of this thesis inquiries from., and one that centres places of impact and the design frictions that emerge in action. In the next chapters I take these Configure-Able Methods into deeper collective inquiries. In these inquiries I form a more nuanced and situated understanding of what practising critical access across multiple technical and social domains made know-able to collaborators and I around our practices of collective configuration. In doing this I aim to show how we can practice disability discourse not as a single issue topic, or where we have to participate in or assimilate to determinate dialogues, but instead centre critical access as a generative place to improvise community infrastructures around and configure interdependent life affirming futures from.
