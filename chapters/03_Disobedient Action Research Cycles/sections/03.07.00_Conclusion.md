## Conclusion

In this chapter I have presented the methodology that my research project has undertaken. As I have shown, it aims to hold together both the embodied practices and resulting knowledges that the crip and queer framing I have previously formulated makes room for and embraces. These methods informed by and developed through disobedient and direct actions within different collaborations and coalitions.

In reflection of and in tandem with the [04.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access](../../04_Configure-able%20methods/sections/04.02.00_Inquiring%20into%20Critical%20Access.md)'s two textures evoked earlier, I am pleased with the ways these actions have unfolded in practice. This has taken my practice from a place of predominantly isolated technical practise to one of orienting on the tables of interdependent action and change within ongoing and emerging groups. This work disobediently follows the line of AR and ILL to understand these projects and practises as ever ongoing. I personally find this wiggle room for continuation cozy, opening up possibilities for how I can collectivley action crip manifestings within diverse localities which are yet to unfold.
