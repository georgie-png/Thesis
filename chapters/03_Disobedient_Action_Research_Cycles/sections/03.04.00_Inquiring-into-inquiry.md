## Inquiring into inquiry

This title pulls from a heading of the same name in Living Life as Inquiry (2021, 445) where Gearty and Marshall undertake inquiry into how LLI has been undertaken in the prior 20 years since its conception. Here similarly I am presenting a pair of my inquiries into how I have been imagining my inquiring. These are presented as two textures and a figuring out through process and code that made room for me to conceptualise how these cycles of Action Research could and were undertaken. The first is from early on in my research, and is an animation focusing on action research as a cyclical process that emerges at other places through a building up of cycles. The second from later on where I was formulating more clearly this disobedient orientation to action research and taking the form of music visuals from collective and interactive poem writing, that is dynamically diagrammed into ever folding and interdependent loops, cycles and rhythms.
