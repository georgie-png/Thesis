### En-crip-ing academic texts - plane -ish text inverted

This section reflects back to the way In-grid and I made wiggled room in the docs of Servpub and their pre-figure formats, so that they were not only accessible to different approaches and abilities, but to also distribute the expertise of these social and technical infrastructures to question and reorient the politics they hold. In the accompanying essay to the En-crip-ing time infrastructure/artwork, that is called *En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&with a SexCI Chronic Job* (Simms & Marangoni, 2025), we practiced how we could approach the pre-configured formats of academic essays and practice to wiggle room into them to make room for the code, practices and capacity to manifest this crip infrastructure. Doing this we disoriented these technologies as a way to query and crip these dialogues both through practice and theory, plan and action, not divided and isolated but tabled together in one place. This was in a very playful, poetic and joyful expression of how these two complex pre-figured formats of technical docs and academic texts can meet, figuring out what impression they make uppon one another when in touch. In this making of contact we manifested these bodies to form questions around forming new variability both in the code, the essay text and the crip times, which they can only represent through their interdependent reading.
