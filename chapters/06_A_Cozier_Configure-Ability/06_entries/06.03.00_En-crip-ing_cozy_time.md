## En-crip-ing cozy time

This section covers both the first collaboration I made with the platform, but also the first overt cripping of network infrastructure the Cozy-Cloud server has made room for. This collaboration was with Mariana Marongoni[^r8] who is a Brazilian transdisciplinary artist, web developer, and researcher based in London. She critically explores media materiality and the aesthetics of decay through installations, web-based experiments, and visual poetry. This collaboration emerged through many bumping intos of each other through our PhD research going to events, conferences and workshops. In these spaces we were crip buddies, chatting, helping each other out, and complaining about how tired/fatigued we were, the lack of access and a desire/need to try cripping relations a little. From this we started to come together to emerge a project or work together and one that could crip the Cozy-Cloud in other informing ways. These initial desires from us turned into the work/infrastructure *En-crip-ing time* which was presented at Mesh festival in Basel[^r9], and accompanied by a published essay *En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&with a SexCI Chronic Job* (Simms & Marangoni, 2025).
