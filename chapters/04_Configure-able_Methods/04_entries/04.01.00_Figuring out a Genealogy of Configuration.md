## Figuring out a Genealogy of Configuration

Like much of the work I am engaged with, Configure-able methods are an attempt to enact methods, practices and their terms so that they can be accessible to and improvised by different positions. The term configure-able, for me gives an initial proposition of disorientation, some sort of re-figuring of configurations through a crip critique of critical access, but also room to configure configurations. In [01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table](../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md) I already covered in great depth my understanding of the background of crip studies and its hacking practices and abilities within technoscience as well as my experiences of disability that informs this understanding in both [01.02.00_The_Crip_Table](../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.00_The_Crip_Table.md) and [02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes](../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md) sections. This definition here then focuses on the pre-intonation of configure before the -able, the orientation before the turn, inflection or retreat. Here I come to this table of configuration, approaching it from this prior one of disability, and in doing so coalesce it closer. In this dance I follow its roots as figures in motion, and so (hopefully) an accessible definition of figures and configuration as an axis that I can inflect and coalesce with critical access and crip theory in the build up to the later [04.02.02_Cripping Configuration](04.02.02_Cripping%20Configuration.md) section.
