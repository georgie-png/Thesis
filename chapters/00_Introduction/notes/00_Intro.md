# 1-2 Sentence intro:

This Chapter aims to introduce the project and the different chapters that make up this thesis. It Also means to setup a foundation of metaphor as a radical tool and situate this work within cosiness as a radical metaphor for life affirming infrastructures. 


# Quick blurb:

This Chapter will introduce the projects approach towards the research, working with metaphor and practice to try to imagine alternatives to the current status quo of big tech infra and norms. It will introduce how the project aims to approach this through crip and trans\*feminist studies as well as STS and software studies to negotiate what the status quo is to then think about how we can start to challenge and move beyond these naturalised norms. It will also explore how the project aims to use developing cycles of action research to bring about these different knowledges through separate but entangled lines of enquiry. It will also give an explanation of each of these chapters and how they mean to represent each of these cycles and a weaving of them together. It will finish off by introducing the work through a cozy metaphor that will set the stage for negotiating infra through life affirmation. 



# Notes:

Part of the collective infra chapter + modified with more focus on metaphor as a way of abstracting things away and around topics in new ways. Tl + Jas special edition, + more histories. ideas of figuration.

Leaving with a foundation of cosines as a radical crip metaphor for the research approach.
