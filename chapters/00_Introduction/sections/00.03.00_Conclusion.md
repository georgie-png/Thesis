## Conclusion 

This thesis and its inquiries go on to shape in action what Configure-able methods can be in these localities. With these inquiries into Configure-able methods in action I ask how can they make room for us to orient from the site of impact within configuration? How can we make room to disorient our plans from the frictions felt in them? And how can we centre crip theory and critical access not only in the ways we organise and care for our communities, but the ways this can shape these hard systems we feel to orient toward the life affirming infrastructures we know we need?
