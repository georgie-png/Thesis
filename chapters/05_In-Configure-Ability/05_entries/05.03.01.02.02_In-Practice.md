##### In-Practice

When reflecting on the frictions that emerged when we configured out these infrastructures we contemplated how to make wiggle room for the dialogues we had together. These processes and practices of making space to reflect on what is being done and how, comes both from the emerging internally methods of In-grid, but have also had an impression made on them when being in contact with other collectives of Servpub collaboration such as Creative Crowds and SysterServer. It also builds up with Hamraie's notion of "design friction"(2023), centring those at the site of impact to re-imagine, redesign and reconfigure the infrastructures and systems they are in touch with. Through these approaches we dedicated time to caring for, feeling out and inquiring into the figures we encountered together within the configurations of these infrastructures. This for me personally was the likes of rubbing up against Tinc's logo (+@fig:tincLogo), an Apache attack helicopter, and being reminded of Isabel Waidner's *We are made of diamond stuff*, where the narrator questions the US military naming practices (2019, pp. 18-23). This is where "They use words as weapons, they use weapons as weapons, and sometimes both come together in the Boeing CH-47 Chinook"(ibid, pp. 22), but also in the case of Tinc and it's Apache logo, how private networks are often conflated with and depicted through militaristic violence and colonial dominance. With a decolonial crip approach I would also understand with Hamraie's crip technoscience[^51], and actioning how we can start to retreat these technical and social networks of privacy away from these sedimented roots of militaristic and colonial violence through community actions of access.

In action and as a group we also found members being lost from graphviz diagrams, maps and representations of this closed VPN network and leaving them unable to help maintain or know these infrastructures easily. This was mainly due to Tinc being both hard to access across In-grid member's variety of operating systems (OS), as well as not much time given by mentors to access Tinc from non-linux systems. As In-grid we had to find hacks and improvisations to work together around these limits, for example using Linux terminals on another OS. There was also the for ever forgotten passwords for the for ever layers of security that these zero trust network norms of domination entail, and which we were not used to accessing. Working within Servpub we also encountered more poetic, symbolic and figural naming practices of computational systems which made wiggle room within them to re-orient these systems througha background of feminist histories, language and variability. 

These configurings out in practice are often impossible to portray through not only a static set of technical docs, but also essays like this here. They are about knowing through practice, and by taking actions within and around the materiality of these technical and social infrastructural relations and to feel their impact on your body. Instead of trying to cure these inevitable gap between theory and practise, In-grid oriented towards developing workshops for people to practise these docs and network practices through configure-able methods for themselves. When an opportunity arose for us to share this work at 4S/EASST 2024 in Amsterdam, we went about thinking how to formulate these practices into the first iteration of our workshop called *Practising Protocols*. This workshop accompanied a panel we organised and brought together with other members of community groups and collectives organising community infrastructures, some from the 8M strike. This included Donna Halford-Lovell from NEoN Digitial presenting their community work around digital access, Julia Nueno presenting her work with app delivery driver communities forming counter apps to unionise and empower with, Femke Snelting from TITiPI sharing their Counter cloud imaginaries, tactics and stickers, as well as members of SHAPE talking about their work.

Bringing the docs into contact with this plurality of community politics, imaginaries, and practice, also provoked us further to make wiggle room for these collective differences of context, needs and sensitivity in these practising protocols workshops. The name of practising protocols itself emerges from both its feminist STS roots, but also through a crip understanding of protocols as a place to dispute expert knowledged of systems through counter protocols[^52]. In doing this we thought of how to trouble the centralised and procedural practices of infrastructures through making more room within the practices they emerge from to localise and situate this knowledge and expertise with that of the working group.

For this initial workshop at 4S/EASST we decided to crop in to the docs to a very basic process of getting into one of the Servpub autonomous servers and collectively editing a html file that was being served online. This HTML would then hold the collective protocols we made during this workshop. We did this as this conference has attendance from a mixture of backgrounds, but is predominantly not a technical expert space. This setting offered us room to test what it meant to make these technical docs and their practices configure-able to people of these varying backgrounds, capacities and expriences. Within these steps of, sshing into the server, entering TMUX[^57], editing a HTML doc in Nano[^58], and exiting the admin session together, we made room and took our time to question what we came into contact with, felt friction around and wanted to configure out otherwise together. This iteration and context gave us great feedback for how to run these workshops, with the final outcomes published publicly on the [panel blog](https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures) and within the [html doc](https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html) we edited live together. From this initial iteration of the workshop we felt like _Practising Protocols_ were a promising way of making room for groups to configuring out infrastructures together through an accessible process that made room for their embodied sense-making and expertise. In this iteration and workshop session it made space for us to emerge with the group a dialogue around how these practices and processes were pre-configured and imagined through specific logics of servitude, users and bodily relations, and ones where we as a group could start to discuss and form our own paths and orientation within, around and/or away from them.

This workshop and panel combined worked well to make room for accessibly dialogues around the technical imaginaries and configuration practices of network infrastructures and collective organising. It formed a context where In-grid and participants could question how communities and collectives come together to form their own approaches, relations and figures locally. It was also a fairly radical to do this with a panel of "experts", that was run by a trans\*feminist collective, and with participants from digital arts charities, union organising and radical counter cloud imaginaries at 4S/EASST. This could also be said for the accompanying workshop that made room for conference members to not only access the terminal and technical network practices together, but to disorient them into a social dialogue in which we configured out these technical practices in action together!

It was also interesting to reflect on how radically different the points of friction and reflection were in this workshop at 4S/EASST, compared to the next iteration with In-grid. This was of course because it was with different people in a different contexts and with slightly altered content. Still though it also shows to me the generative capacity the *Practicing Protocols* workshops have for disorienting the norms of network configurations by making room for divergent and situated dialogues that bring technologies in touch with and reverberating from the bodies they impact.
