### Configure-ability In-Docs

A lot of this specific practice is currently being written up on the [Servpub Wikic4Print](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Chapter_3:_Praxis_Doubling), and orients these reflections through a collaborative text alongside other members of In-grid, which this thesis restraints do not make room for. Here though I want to surface how in collaboration with In-grid, and with my critical input from this research we collectively tried to query the norms of technical practice, and their docs through critical access. By taking up critical access here we are both asking how can we make room for these practices and their knowledges to be more accessible to wider groups and dialogues through the ways we describe and format this information, but also how this can make space for people to dispute, unsediment and disorient together the network infrastructures we have inherited.

Carrying on the framing from the [05.02_Processing In-Configure-ability](05.02_Processing%20In-Configure-ability.md) section, where In-grid orients approaching systemic inflexibility through our collective practice of In-flex-ability, I share how we have started to make room around these norms.
