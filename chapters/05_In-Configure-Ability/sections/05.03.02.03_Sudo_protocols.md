#### Sudo protocols

Once logged in to the server through SSH we reached *Sudo*, which is the command "super user do". This is needed to do most of the admin tasks on a server as it gives you the rights to do so. Here we found friction with this sort of responsibility and expertise being individualised to specific "super" users and that imagined body. In response to this we turned to orient around interdependence as a way to not only slow each other down and see things from a number of perspectives but to hold each other response-able through our distributed expertise. We also questioned how we could do this, asking questions like "can we track who is doing what as sudo?" Instead in conversation In-grid turned to questions of how we as a group could not formalise trust through security, tracking, etc., but through social technologies of interdependence, moving to further build trust between us socially, instead of solely through our technical systems.
