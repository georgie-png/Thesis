### Figuring out In-flex-ability

When it came to defining In-flex-ability in a similar way, and where I had prepared some prompts and questions, we instead decided to orient to figuring it out in inquire and action. Here we reflected on how we improvised other ways of approaching these places of friction within the sedimented norms we felt friction with. As a group we decided on which practice's frictions and misfittings we wanted to orient from and in which ways we wanted to approach them. This resulted in us making sense of in-flex-ability by reflecting on the inflexibilty we felt in our processes and practices of *De/re-clouding*, *Coalition and knowledge exchange* and our *In-ternal politics*. When doing these it took us a minute to warm up to this framing of inflexibility/in-flex-ability, but through this emerged some interesting points of collective reflection.
