##### In-Docs

To question the accessibility of technical language and sedimented formats of technical docs I suggested we look to crip studies and Kelsie Acton's chapter *Plain Language for Disability Culture* (2023). This chapter by Acton orients how to approach language, structuring and formating to re-configure them into accessible plain language. This is not meant as a a reduction of what is there but a reinterpretation of how we represent, translate and figure these relations and dynamics to/with others in accessible forms. It is also meant as a way to open up different discourses, such as technical ones like these, to be within reach of the disabled community. In this approach challenging the scope of what disabled people (and others) can have agency around, access to and intimacy with. Here informed by her concept we actioned this inquiry by firstly being conscious of Acton's principles[^r3] but also thinking through how we can localise this dialogue into technical docs and our own capacities. To do this we were turned to Acton's plain language version of Alice Wong's anthology of essays called *Disability Intimacy* (2024), which informed us how to orient towards plain language. We situated these alongside the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)[^r4] to think about how a Plain -ish Language WCAG (P-ish-LWCAG) might be oriented.

With this in focus In-grid started to reconfigure the limits of docs by trying to make room within their norms for them to be accessible and improvisable by different capacities and approaches. One way we did this was by making more room in the introductory sections of docs to hold accessible information about the background of this infrastructure, what these technologies are and why we are using them. With this metaphorical curb cut in the intro, we aimed to form accessible ways in for people to relate to these practices accessibly with no specific background in the technical procedures they represents. In doing this we made room for bodies which did not maintain that of a super user or expert and instead tried our best to make their dynamics and relations easily understandable by covering technical elements that the norms of docs from our experience often brushed over. 

Through this approach we also emerged our own syntax and formats for clearly signing both links and technical code elements. For links this oriented giving extra short descriptions below them for people to get a better idea of what lay beyond.  For the code inserts we started to form our own standards of how to make the technical syntax docs encoded more legible and accessible. To do this in code exerts we highlighted \<variables\> with these brackets, and followed this up with how we had run them ourselves. There is an example quoted below. We did this to emphasise the readers capacity to adapt these practices to the persons own technical context, and not constrain them as a specific user and determined technical infrastructure. In this motion troubling the procedural deterministic norms of docs to instead make room for people to access these practices and knowledges through divergent disorienting dialogues.

Towards the end of writing the docs (which is actually after the workshops I talk about next) we also found through extended networks outside of Servpub of an earlier documentation from the XPUB docs[^r5] as well as Lurk's *RUN YOUR OWN*[^r6], that the VPN parts of the Servpub infrastructure were based on. These clearly showed how to setup these systems and would have saved us lots of time configuring out these infrastructures. It would have been sensible to follow the efficient "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) mantra of course, but in some ways this repetition, or what *Get the frac in* (Maier et al., 2020) might explain as a "Tic", lead us to repeat the same stuff but maybe as plain-ish stuff. At this later stage we were also facing the fact that the VPN elements of these docs (TINC) were becoming deprecated. Feeling both of these frictions we decided to reorient again from the norms of docs being an active site to pose these docs as more of an archive and document and make accessible In-grid's background of where and who this infrastructure had come from and what our intentions were when making them. Here forming wiggle room for these histories and genealogies of infrastructures, and to share how different bodies, relations and practice can transform and disorient these norms in when bringing them into context.
