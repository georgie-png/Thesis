#### Coding protocols

This room was made at the beginning of the workshop and before we started the technical parts of workshop to make space for us to reflect on and propose our codes of conduct together before we encode our social and technical infrastructures through them. We questioned how we desired to work together on this server and what relations we imagined and planned for ourselves. Here we focused on interdependence, on doing things in pairs, keeping people in-sync and enabling a-sync processes. We also focused on working slowly, being soft, and double, no triple checking before we do things. There was also a focus on documentation, not only as a way of keeping people in-sync, but also as a way to roll back or undo decisions and actions (where possible).
