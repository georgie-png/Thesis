#### SSH protocols

Here we formed rubbed up against and wiggled room within the secure shell (SSH) protocol, which is the protocol that lets you log into the server. This is the first point that we came into contact with the server, and SSH configures the way we can connect, interface and be intimate with our server. There is little written feedback in the workshop notes on the pad, apart from "1. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced". This note leads from a conversation we had about the embedded metaphor and figure of SSH as a hand shake. Within this conversation we opened up dialogues around the figures we want to replace. Instead of a handshake which reinforces able bodiedness within a normid user and with that the hierarchical relation and inaccessible contract making between particular kinds of bodies. Here we started to imagine what metaphors we wanted to configure our relations to our infrastructure through. This particular friction did not generate any outcomes of counter figures, unlike others latter on, as I feel we may have still been warming into the process.  It did though open up this dialogue of how we wanted to move towards other figures of our own. We wanted to find a practice and relation where we do not negate or hide these histories in our retreat from them, but re-orient and reform their bodies and relations through the impression of our retreat.
