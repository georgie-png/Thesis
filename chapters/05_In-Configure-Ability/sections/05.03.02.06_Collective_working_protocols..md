#### Collective working protocols.

This point we joined up together within TMUX, which is a terminal multiplexer. This sounds very complicated, but basically lets you work collaboratively within one terminal together. I wanted to bring this collaborative interface into focus as it does have many restraints and frictions for collaborative working. These range from basic things like classic obscure terminal copy and paste commands, but also that there is only one person able to write at one time, and the possibility of accidentally loosing sessions by typing exit (even in another command). In the pad and session though the reflections focus mainly on technical elements of TMUX as the limits above gave us a few technical issues members couldn't quite get beyond. We were also running a little out of time so decided to move on from this and to focus on writing the manifesto together. Reflecting on this brief contact though, it was interesting to see how collaboration in these technologies is configured through very restrictive relations, and when a group like us, who collaborate in a number of dynamics and approaches, found this pre-configured relation too tight and misfitting to our needs. In-grid was definitely not the imagined expert users of TMUX, but being in touch with these constrained collaborative environments showed us how much these relations needed us to form wiggle room within them, as they were frictious to use.
