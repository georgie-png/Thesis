#### In-ternal politics

Here In-grid turned in-ward to frictions within how we as a group figure out and orient our own collective politics in practice. This focus offered us room to reflect on how we as a group form goals and orient towards them. In this dialogue we also made room to question what those goals currently are. It also has to be said that this was definitely the most fun topic to chat about, with lots of joy and giggles, when reflecting on these impact of these frictions and our resulting care for them.

The inflexibility we felt here orients a number of matters. This is explicit when we question what is possible with limited funding, what we can squeeze in around work and what (if any) of our activities are understood as valid and valued within these systems. We also touched upon how we as students of these academic institutions, teachers and researchers within them, as well as within the norms of other computing/creative industries have inherited and sedimented the politics and norms of these bodies within us. Here we ask how these norms reinforce us to be inflexible in certain ways so that the contingent politics and relations we orient towards are out of reach. One example we experienced and raised around this came from both academic institutional norms, as well as ones of communities around us, and which oriented towards the ease of centring knowledge in individuals as it was more efficient than dispersing it into collective knowledges. This centring of practises and their knowledges though situates all the capacity to do certain things within certain people. Here by not taking on this troublesome task of distributing these practices and their knowledges the organisation can loose these capacities easily in doing so, through certain people leaving, becoming ill/mad/dissociative or passing. Beyond this consolidating these practices and their knowledges into an individual also takes them out of reach of others, and makes no room for them to know those practices and politics as a group, or the plurality knowings that makes room for.

In-response we reflected on how In-grid made room within and around these normalised institutionalised practices of management and collaboration that we have experienced. Becky and Katie surfaced a joke they have here about how if anyone needed to understand In-grid's methods and process, they should read the *Simple Sabotage Field Manual* (1944) by the CIA. This is not true in every way, we are not out to break our own things, like this manual suggest for taking down fascist states and their infrastructures. Instead when approaching collective practice In-grid is slow and we take our time, we are dedicated to working in large groups[^r10], have many misunderstandings[^r11], and lots of emotions to share[^r12]. These actions for us, and maybe because many in the manual were appropriated from anti-fascist, communist and anarchist movements are the many practices we have to come to decisions, build trust and get consensus from different members on our orientations. The many ways we orient this differently to the CIA manual of course is that the actions we take are done through love and care, where we aim to build up In-grid's relations, instead of weaponizing them. In many ways this shares how we do break down efficient management systems, but In-grids orients towards other ways of being together instead of replacing one fascist state with another. It is only through years of these relations building up that we have emerged the trust that makes room for members to take different approaches, forget what we were doing, and to be okay with being uncomfortable. For example getting our cloud setup moved to Servus took over a year to get everyone set up with account on it and for us to feel like we as a group knew what we are doing there. Still though there are some members who don't want to be on there and that is fine, and we have found ways to be in-flex-able around these points of friction so to not excluded them. In these ticing practices we build trust and patience in letting people manage their own way to reflect on and learn from our collective practices and their frictions. This demonstrates well our practice of in-flex-ability, and shares how we have wiggled room together within the sedimented and inherited norms for the flexibility In-grids member's need and manifest to be together within these inflexible systems and times.
