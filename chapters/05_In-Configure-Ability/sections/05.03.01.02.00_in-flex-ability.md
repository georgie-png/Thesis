#### in-flex-ability

In questioning the horizon of these norms and the inflexibility we had felt both in the inherited configurations of technical docs as well as the social relations of how they were shared in practice we wanted to care for these frictions through In-grid's own background and promise of collective access. This sub group of In-grid members met many times together over a greenhost jitsi video calls as we often do to bring into collective dialogue how we wanted to reorient this in practice and through our actions. Some of the constraints we wanted to rub up against and questioned were how to make space for the backgrounds, promises and politics of our collective practices into these technical doc formats. 

In making this space within these constrained practices for our own flexible ways of working and politics, we were also keen to inquire how we also wiggle room for others to disorient and configure out these docs otherwise for them selves. Through the inflexible framing of docs that I set out earlier these docs formats are encrypted often just for a technical expert or super user. within this shaping of a user we also wanted to challenge this roles scoping and bodily horizons to make room for others to intersect and access them from many abilities, capacities and experiences. This approach aiming to not just centre the compliant technical expert and designer but make room for a figure of a disobedient user who brings with them their community and context.
