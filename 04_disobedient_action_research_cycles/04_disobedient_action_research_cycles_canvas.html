class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This section brings into focus why this research has oriented towards action research as a methodology. Following on from the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> chapter and its framing of embodied and relational politics I have found that action research aligns and intersects at a number of places that are key. To trace these crossing lines I am working with Judi Marshall's notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty and Marshall 2021; Marshall 1999) and Living Systemic Thinking (Marshall 2004) that make room for me to not only take on the calls for action I have made in the previous chapter but also to bring into those actions the necessary reflection that quality inquiry and research entails<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-68b60d6d7df450ed" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-68b60d6d7df450ed"><a data-footref="31" href="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-1-68b60d6d7df450ed" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Marshall's LLI (1999; 2004; Gearty and Marshall 2021) work is a specific type of action research named first person action research, which is where the first intersection crosses paths with my proposed framework. In first person action research Marshall is in many ways practicing a methodology that makes room for the background of the practitioner to settle in, like Ahmed (2006), and brings in the context, relations and feelings of the person making the research. In her essay <em>Living Life as Inquiry -- a Systemic Practice for Change Agents (2021)</em> with Margaret Rose Gearty, which acts as a 20 year celebration and retrospective since the paper and method was first published and to examine how LLI has been taken up in many orientations. There are a number of focuses in this essay on how <em>Living Life as Inquiry</em> can be practised but there is a key focus on how it makes room for an embodiment of research. Marshall phrases it as "Inquiry has woven itself into my life" (2021, 454). This embodiment and weaving of research into life is key for my practice as it makes room for me to wiggle into this research, my experiences of being crip and queer within and around institutional limits and their relations. It let's me situate this research to my context, to think through what it means for me as a middle class 'white', crip and queer researcher, with chronic illness, pain and fatigue to be approaching deeply neo-liberal and efficiency driven institutions in the UK. This embodiment of research also enables me to think about how these positions of practice and of making embodied actions is itself a space of knowledge generation, and one that finds the capture or determination of these knowledges impossible in many ways. In Living Systemic Thinking (2004) Marshall gives the example of her colleagues and her reflecting on a review process of a student, to a fine grain of reflection, and shows how each person interprets these relations differently. She approaches this not to de-validate the difference and nuance but to work with these varied perspectives as other orientations of an issue, that form their own understandings of these actions and their relations to them (ibid, 15). Marshall's position on the embodiment of research also offers me to bring feelings and affect into practice, intersecting with a crip focus on affectivity. This navigation of embodiment informs my orientation of actions and their deliberation to not be led by but to account for how it has felt within the relations, how what is expected causes friction or how what I desire to undertake brings joy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With this engagement of self, of bringing feelings into action, and those actions into inquiry and knowing they pose another way of orienting myself. Marshall and Gearty through their approach to LLI also ask of me to think about how I direct or orient myself, much like I discussed in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a> section through the work of Ahmed. With LLI they think through how these practitioner and actioned knowledges that I practice, can in themselves form alternative orientations to those of hegemony and institutions. In an essay called <em>Living Systemic Thinking</em> (ibid) Marshall terms it as "sense making", and later on her and Gearty ask us to work with this sensing think through "when to persist or desist" (2021, 457) in direction. With this they present Living Life as Inquiry as a method to process what to inquire into and how to orient relational actions towards that outcome. To do this in this embodied context they work with a few notions to consider how to feel out what is appropriate to be done in that context. They talk about "staying fresh and open" (ibid, 455), where by taking life into inquiry, we question our habits, our sedimented patterns and norms to think through and feel out other approaches and paths to the outcome. To do this they propose "checking for signs of vitality" (ibid, 455) as a way to do pulse-checks, to ask "How am I, here and now?", and to balance between inquiring mindlessly forward and being stuck within the fine grain and frozen. They also pose these pulse-checks to be embodied and not always consciously reasoned to aim to unravel the notion of "pursuit" within research. This is where I can move away from a determined end goal or sedimented straight path and tending towards feeling out dynamic and emerging research to decide the next actions to make. They also bring up the notion of "working with emotions"( ibid, 456) as a way to inquire into "what is really important", of connecting to the issue on an embodied level and letting these feelings not determine but be engaged in what I feel I need to tend to.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This leads onto their proposition of "practices of discernment" (ibid, 457), which interestingly isn't about where to act but more about when. As they note it can be about discerning when to be "waiting things out" and when to be working out "what is what" before deciding how to act, positioning Marshall's notion on "when to persist or desist" within time. Practising this within Ahmed's framing of inherited and sedimented relations makes room for me to think, where am I now, and what can I change within my reach. In a textural response to this notion Marshall and Gearty give the image of the Heron/yoga pose, of one leg in the water, of feeling the ripples and many forms of data lap against your body and to patiently discern what they mean and what/when to action. They follow this texture with their notion of "the timely move to action" (ibid, 458), which continues to ask how and when to take actions of inquiry but also where. In this embodied methodology they prompt us to think through where this can be in the relations we are entangled into, which can be an internal action on the self, or an "inward action" as they term it. In doing this though they don't divide between what they call the inward and outward arcs of action, but instead see them as performances of an entangled process. This prompts this research to re-scope where the actions of action research can be taken when embodied in research, and has pushed me as a practitioner to inquire into how I am internally orienting practices and how this is affected by and affecting outward actions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Following on from (but also maybe before/during) is their conception of reflection of action. Why I say maybe before/during is due to the troubling of the separation of action and reflection that LLI encourages. Instead with LLI Marshall and Gearty ask me to be open to the complex ways that these movements of action and reflection are entwined and interdependent, with reflection being in many ways an action in itself. Within this dialogue of reflection in mind they form another few notions to think with and help reflect on what matters within and around our actions. They ask us to revisit the "inner and outer arcs of attention" (ibid, 458), and that by taking time with both the internal embodied and external actions each will inform and develop the understanding of one another. Somewhat intersecting with crip theory they compare the entanglement of these arcs to that of the bodymind, and its move to dissolve the boundary between the two, where action and reflection move as one muscle. This is also closely read into in <em>Living Systemic Thinking (2004)</em> where Marshall takes up a close reading and reflection of their approach at each stage in line with feedback from colleagues to deliver a quality emerging inquiry into institutional processes through her enactment and relation to them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Returning to LLI they also work with the notion of "the processual nature of inquiry" (ibid, 459) that prompts us to approach these cycles of sense-making as ways to move beyond the determined and inherited generalised models of research and instead situate these orientating processes within the embodied practices of the researcher. In these modes of orienting they pose knowledge as ephemeral and fleeting as it sits within the relation of action and practice. They open to reflection that does not model, generalise and predetermine moments but evoke practice that makes room for me to visit the relations I engage in afresh to rethink the sedimented paths we take towards them. In this move and throughout the paper they also open up to what they call <em>textures</em>, such as the Heron description above, which takes the form of images, figures and reflections that act as experiments of how to express these feelings, practices and enquires where words may fail us. This orientation of modes of reflection within Action Research intersects well with a crip position, and one which I relate to a lot, where words can escape me. Here they make room for these discursive knowledges through embodied technical and social practices to be validated as generative ways of getting to know the relational "problems" at hand through other revealing practices. How drawing, metaphoring and coding can be ways to reflect and key modes of action, inquiry and sense-making. The last notion they leave us with is that of "reviewing generative/degenerative aspects of inquiry" (2021, 459), and is a very kind one that in many ways echo's that of pulse-checking. With this notion they discuss the balance you have to take in first-person inquiry to not get caught in self-critical cycles, which can stop actions from taking place and trap researchers inward. To manage this line they say to monitor what is being looked at, with degenerative inquiry being characterised by "over-rumination or joylessness". Here again aligning with a crip move to imagine disalignment as a generative site, and one where there is always a possibility of joy and pleasure. This is again where in places within myself and in relation to others, we can inquire into how these sites of friction as not invalidated and determined actions of humiliation, pain and duress, but how they make room for the possibility to be joyous and pleasurable places of inquiry.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Bringing LLI into action in this research has empowered me undertaking it in a number of ways. It has made room for me to unfold and situate the research within my manys contexts and practices as a crip and queer researcher throughout the PhD. It has also prompted me to engage my feelings, bodily relations and emotions into an embodied research practice. It has given space to the technical and social practices I undertake, of thinking through code, finding frictions in coalition and of trying to survive within and around these institutions, as generative and informative textures of this research. It has also buffered these crip and queer notions of finding our own paths together, and that those are ones we desire, find vital and map to our bodies. In retrospect first person inquiry has given my research practice the capacity to change paths. For example a key turning point in this research is that through quality inquiry I decided to desist working with and for certain logics of automation and organisation that invoke and determine dominative centralised control and come from violent ableist and eugenics histories. Instead to step back, reorient and persist at the practice of social infrastructure that inform how to decentralise and disorient their technical counterpart through community interdependence and critical access.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this move to desist to then persist I found though that there were some crip frictions I have with this framing of LLI and Action Research here. Even though they counter narratives of pursuit and make rooms for finding my own way through embodied practices, their focus can be somewhat be Cripped more in relation to instituional processes. When Marshall references Meyerson and Scully's concept of "tempered radicals" (1999, 3) it is hard to imagine crip theory so normalised, subdued and conformed. Of course we get "heated up and cooled down" when "being simultaneously outsider and insider" of institutions, but it is not about getting "tougher". I know that in my inquiry I have moved, sometimes without reason from being tempered, to flexible, to brittle, to wet, to rusted, to loose and to tempered again. This isn't to say this divergence isn't possible within First Person AR, but the Crip orientation I desire aims to move beyond the need to be tempered towards institutional norms and our manifestings, as being tempered may make unlivable the many approaches to a crip notion of justice and radical access before they even begin. This is not to say being tempered and playing the valid role of "user" or "expert" to subvert or hack, or to reflect on the ways we emerge in relation to institutions are not valid in this critique. It is instead to disorient this table of action and to make known-able through critical access, the labours and their knowledges that these institutions invalidate. In relation to my experiences from and orientation to institutions and their imaginary possibility for these radical politics and social relations we call for is that they are limited through very restrictive terms that collectively in my collaborations, we can only form small amounts of wiggle room within and around. To find the space and relations that I desire and that can start to make room for these sorts of imaginary practices I turned disobediently from methods where I have to be tempered, and I have disoriented this through crip theory, interdependence and of movement making. This isn't to neglect the change I can and have made in the institution, but it is to pivot from crip futures they cannot hold. It is to make time and room to feel out my orientation towards these more restrictive and sedimented organisational practices of institutions, and figure out how to counter them. </p></div><div></div><div>

This is specifically true when it comes to Crip studies where the sedimented path into action research would be through participatory research. A quality example of this, and similarly to my research is the blurring of the lines of community and institution is Laura J. Wernick's <em>Learning Disability Justice through Critical Participatory Action Research</em> (2023). With this work she focuses on the notion of participatory to surface the ways that disabled interdependence is what has made her research happen. She also reflects on these exchanges in a very embodied, vulnerable and situated approach that a Crip studies approach encourages. This embodied mode being one that also crosses heavily into First Person Action Research. In my research I have similarly manifested it through these Crip support networks, through interdependence and from community, and I definitely do not want to underplay their participation in this work. I do though chose to orient towards First Person Action Research as I want to focus not so much on disabled people participating in the institutional norms or within disabled exclusive space, but instead towards how crip people as active change makers can transform the more intersectional organisations, institutions and systems around us. In this move putting pressure on, making friction with and giving feedback to the ableist institutions and relations we are in-touch with. This again isn't to say that the work like Wernick's that practice Participatory AR methods are not in reach of this change on their bodily horizon, but it is to instead orient towards this, and see how this imposition can change relations and politics around us.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">04.02.00_Why-not-other_Action-Research</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 4; transform: translate(-800px, 1720px); width: 940px; height: 400px; --canvas-node-width: 940px; --canvas-node-height: 400px; --canvas-color: 55,46,87;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Bringing Disobedience Into Action" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Bringing_Disobedience_Into_Action"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Bringing Disobedience Into Action</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it comes to bringing these disobedient methods into my Action Research, I am informed by TITiPI's questioning of the roles and relations we play when debugging systems. In this thinking about the scales, relations and capacities we need to make room for the communities, technologies and change we desire right now. This disobedience intersecting with the crip cyborg (Kafer 2013), and the health rebel (Kafer 2017), engaging with and stepping out of line from the violent norms of computational systems and institutional logics. In doing this I am also turning to see how these practices of forming counter narratives, figures and manifestings of sociotechnical fables can be brought into action in the making of collective infrastructures. Asking how can my collaborators and I imagine other ways of relating with these technologies in retreat from their violent origins and contemporary uses and towards manifesting our own imaginaries and politics around them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With a queer disobedience I also take actions through transdisciplinary approaches which echo Ahmed's wiggle room (2014) loosening of determined roles to performances. In this wiggling making room with this disobedience for the roles and discipline within research, forming queer lines between them. Here I aim to perform these disciplines with respect and to high quality but along my own lines that subvert the ones they were  prescribed to as isolated institutional discipline.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Disobedience has also been taken along inward arcs of action and into my internal enquiry and practice. I do this to think through how I can orient my inquiry by being in touch with the relations I am entangled in as a crip and queer researcher. This has taken the work mentioned in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md" href="../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction to this research, being individually focused and technologically centred practice, to now being disorient by collective bodies and practices that orients the social of infrastructure, with the assistance of technical. Taking up disobedient action research made room for me to desist from engaging in what felt like assimilation practices of computing, to then move to persist with other ways of imagining crip capacities for care, coalition and interdependence.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Throughout the research there is a returning to a disobedient motion.

It provides us with inscriptions, de-scriptions and re-in-terpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along." (Rocha and Snelting 2017, 45)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is the point when this first person action research becomes a disobedient form of Action Research. This is because it makes room for these practices to move away from and refuse the institutional and hegemonic norms that a crip orientation of justice also refuses. Much like the disobedient demand of the <em>Crip Technoscience Manifesto</em> which I work with, and moves to access through friction (Hamraie and Fritsch 2019, 10), disobedient action poses us to take direct actions now! It aims to form futures within and around institutes that can't hold them yet, and defiantly practice politics that they are not ready to imagine. In the essay '<em>We Have Always Been Geohackers</em>' (2021) by Helen Pritchard, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting, they position the methodology of Disobedient Action Research as a means to re-scope and re-think how we practice questioning, maintaining and developing sociotechnical systems and infrastructures. As they pose it through this essay, what does it mean to debug a system in the context of computing, its institutions and politics that hold it in place. In the contexts and configurations of their interventions, they ask how normative/obedient debugging in open source communities often reinforces systems instead of questioning and transforming them. Through their analysis they focus on how breaking up the "hardest problems" into "tiny" and "squeezable" bugs can limit what can be said and done. This question can also be easily applied through crip studies, where we could ask how does fitting into and assimilating to the institution's "squeezable" terms of access actually limit the contingent possibilities of change we could make otherwise?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In their essay they take up the debugging of Gplates, a free software tool and web-portal for tectonic plate modelling and mineral prediction for extraction. This debugging took place in a collective workshop where a group of non-technocrats, nor technical specialists  produced their own independent knowledge, expertise and critiques of how these systems figure tectonic movements and their volumetric predictions of mineral resources. Through these non-hegemonic counter figures, the group questioned the naturalised aesthetics and navigational tools of Gplates. This includes questioning the representations of the globe's default as a blank grey orb awaiting to be projected on us by the god like viewer (+@fig:grey), reinforced through to the time slider that lets you smoothly slide through "mega-annums of geological time" (ibid, 250). In questioning the software through these actions and reflections, they open up conversations of what agencies does the earth, and those bodies living on it have (ibid, 252-53). When a software has tool names orientating "grabbing", especially around land, minerals and bodies, what semantics, meaning and use does this inscribe (ibid, 252).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Figure from the We have always been Gephackers chapter, which they caption &quot;Gplates interface before loading geodata (grey earth)&quot;" src="../04_media/Gplates_interface.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Figure from the We have always been Gephackers chapter, which they caption &quot;Gplates interface before loading geodata (grey earth)&quot;" src="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/gplates_interface.png" target="_self"></span>{#fig:grey}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Bringing these insights back to their critique of debugging. In this emerging practises that don't try to"isolate" these huge and complex issues so that they are squeezable within hegemonic logics of debugging. Instead try to feel out and validate situated, nuanced and ephemeral critiques that can't be reproducible for a developer or for a rigorous study. This is where they encourage me<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-df7f0ac131df41ec"><a data-footref="q2" href="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-1-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup> to be disobedient to these norms and instead of scaling down bugs, try to practice them across scales of time and space, displacing and intersecting the iterations and versions across software development.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Much like Ahmed's relating to lesbian roles of butch-femme as performances and not determined roles that I cover in <a data-href="02.01.02_Queering_the_axis" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.02_queering_the_axis.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.01.02_Queering_the_axis</a>, being disobedient doesn't aim to reject or discredit fields of expertise, practices, scales and knowledges that it works with but to trouble their performances and problematize their aftermath. This orients these disobedient actions, so I aim to feel their frictions and to question how technical systems are imagined, executed and orientated, moving to figure out how I (and others) can imagine and practise with them otherwise. Intersecting here with a crip set of political/relational scales, this refuses access and equality through assimilation or prescribed terms, but instead makes room to locally image sets of demands and actions to make. Here I reflect to Collin Kennedy, who is mentioned in the <em>Crip Techniscience Manifesto</em>, and I touched upon earlier in  <a data-href="02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>. His refusal to pay to park, and access his care is radically out of the bugs an access form is imagined to hold, but also questions time, relational access, and capitalised care.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Gplates debugging in We Have Always Been Geohackers (ibid) is only one of a number that they have taken on. These later impositions through their organisation <em>The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest</em> (TITiPI) and with many collaborators. Through these instances they are practising disobedience to the norms of big tech's expansive and violent development. They inquire into how they can gain purchase and get to grips with what they have capacity to change through challenging the sedimentations of norms and taking direct action to re-orient them now. Other examples of these intersections take place on github where through these disobedient terms of action research they enthusiastically are "always-already entangled"(Barad 2007). With "The long tail of contact tracing"(Aouragh, Pritchard, and Snelting 2020b; 2020a) they pose some of these "Hardest Problems" to contact tracing technologies during the Covid pandemic and their norms towards surveillance methods and discrimination on the DP-3T (Decentralised Privacy - Preserving Proximity Tracing ) documents repository. In the DP-3T repo<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-df7f0ac131df41ec"><a data-footref="q3" href="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-2-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, as a place already somewhat critical of the hegemonic centralised norms of other contact tracing algorithms, welcomed these critiques and conversations, and these direct provocations evoked dialogue within that development community. Other repos did not respond in a similar way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In <em>EU Digital COVID Certificates: When governments move fast and break things</em> (Aouragh et al. 2021b; 2021a) a critique of the EU DCC (Digital Covid Certificate), this was not the same case. Their commentary in the issue post/bug report was that a new idtoken which tracks each person's COVID status and (dis/en)ables them travel and move, as being something that we should be very cautious of. This is especially the case when there are no safeguards around who can read and use the data stored in the QR codes. This is also doubled by the fact that many of the medical infrastructures in Europe are not fully digitised, and this approach enforces them to "scale up" these specific digital surveillance systems immediately to comply. They point out that such quick move to restrictive measures through digital surveillance infrastructures will undoubtedly hit many issues, which in these cases will deeply affect the lives of people "cared" for by these systems. Here the disobedient debugging was not met by the same sort of reception as on the DP-3T post, but instead was within a day commented on<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-df7f0ac131df41ec"><a data-footref="q4" href="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-3-df7f0ac131df41ec" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup> to say it was in the wrong section (a technical forum) for this type of discussion. As in it was not a squeezable bug they would accept. It was then immediately closed and moved to a limited discussion for just private collaborators of the repo.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another example of disobedience from them is in their bug report of Frontier Climate (Aouragh et al. [2017] 2024a; [2017] 2024b) where they critique Big Techs selling of carbon credits and offset as a means to not reduce, but expand carbon exploration and dependency. This debugging showed a different face than the rest, as Frontier totally deleted the post. This move to delete, instead of the normative sideline, close down and avoid, shows the power of these comments and their direct actions to that company. It shows how these critiques if tabled could potentially reorient things, so have to be thrown off.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">These disobedient intersections not only, as said in Pritchard's talk at 4S*EASST (2024), "give feedback where it is not always wanted", but in this direct action of giving feedback to them publicly it shows us how receptive these organisations and projects are to scaled up bugs. In their response we can publicly note if they listen and join the discussion. In this we can also feel them wriggle as they (not so) subtly restrict the bug to a side room away from discourse. When they give this feedback and try to get to grips with these scaled up buds, it is easy to know when they pull away, and into retreat as they delete the commentary from existence. In these disobedient actions they force the hand of the repository/software maintainer to not only engage with political commentary and critiques, but to also position themselves in relation to it publicly. Do they engage, avoid or squeeze these bugs however possible? are they too big for them to manage and so they avoid or do they feel their hold so delete them out of existence? Here I am thinking of disobedience as a practice to change how dynamics are performed to show relations, people and bodies under another spectrum, and to figure out what roles they perform when taken off script. Reflecting back to <a data-href="02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, these practices align with those of access as friction, and that of the "non-compliant user", wiggling room for dialogues where they have been silenced.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another key part of this "giving feedback where it is not always wanted" is that of making room for and building up this feedback that is not wanted. It is about collectively telling other stories of technologies, infrastructures and policies, than the rhetoric of their management. Here we can turn to TITiPI and friends work on infrables (2022), where they present methods for building up bugs from embodied and experienced relations of infrastructure. These methods not only build from those of first-person action research but also follow on from a crip orienting from the sites of impact of infrastructure and politics to inform the change needed. The work of infrables takes these processes on by developing a collaborative workshop and practice to unfold these other stories of Big Tech infrastructures. In this workshop practising ways to perform and transform anecdotes of infrastructures and their institutions into fables that can challenge those of mainstream and dominant narratives. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Bringing this into crip centred methods, I turn to the work of Nat Decker and Cielo Saucedo's <em>Cripping_Computer_Graphics</em> (2023). Here they similarly offer up how cripping as method makes wiggle room for crip bodies within 3D environments, as well as wider relations and norms of computation institutions. Here taking up Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of "cripping" (2003, 37) as method to make room to feel the disorientations of crip bodies in relations to the norms of these technologies. Here they question how the diversity and many intersections of crip bodies disorient the normalised forms and mechanics of computer graphics, from the avatars to the ways they are rigged, and even how these virtual bodies are licensed and sold. Here they again make room for their crip expertise to question the sedimented bodies and limits of these systems.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As I shared in the  last two chapters the dominant terms are ones of silencing disabled and frictious voices to keep the narrative straight and to rule out any queries. By making room to tell these counter stories, and disobediently performing them as fables, this work aims to disorient how infrastructures and their aftermaths are felt and understood through centring the expertise and knowledges of the communities they are in touch with. These impact centred method are where I bring in these embodied elements of action research, of working with crip practitioner knowledge to animate the lines that are drawn and what is naturalised and sedimented as the norm.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

Here similarly I am presenting a pair of my inquiries into how I have been imagining my inquiring. These are presented as two textures and a figuring out through process and code that made room for me to conceptualise how these cycles of Action Research could and were undertaken. The first is from early on in my research, and is an animation focusing on action research as a cyclical process that emerges at other places through a building up of cycles. The second from later on where I was formulating more clearly this disobedient orientation to action research and taking the form of music visuals from collective and interactive poem writing, that is dynamically diagrammed into ever folding and interdependent loops, cycles and rhythms.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">04.04.00_Inquiring-into-inquiry</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 7; transform: translate(1560px, 2560px); width: 466px; height: 400px; --canvas-node-width: 466px; --canvas-node-height: 400px; --canvas-color: 52,91,96;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Texture 2" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Texture_2"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Texture 2</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="A screenshot of the work generating looped diagrams (top) from the collective etherpad (bellow)" src="../04_media/Pad_Loop.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="A screenshot of the work generating looped diagrams (top) from the collective etherpad (bellow)" src="04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/pad_loop.png" target="_self"></span>{#fig:loops}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This texture and artwork came about as I was trying to reflectively figure out how these disobedient actions had taken place.

Looking back at this animation the cycles presented imagine them as quite linear and deterministic. The form these cycles build up into are also somewhat walled in, hiding the inner arcs and sub-cycles of process.

The methodology I have taken up is a situated implementation of disobedient action research. This disobedience and its foundations of action research follows the many crip and queer figures that were called on in the last chapter, and especially within <a data-href="02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, where it demands to step out of line, to find other routes that institutional inflexibilities do not have the capacity for and to defiantly take those actions now.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this move to shake off the the academic table of methods that holds us in-line, I turned to action research as a place to empower the position of practitioners (in this case collaborators and I) as a knowledge creators. This methodology approaches these experiences by giving depth and insight to relations where an embodied framing makes room for it to be understood in action, from a situated perspective and knowledge. I then move to orient this methodology through first person action research, where I bring in the background of my research and to make room within it for a situated embodiment of these inquiries. From this position and that of my crip framing, I felt this research necessitates a disobedient approach, one that manifests a disorientation of the scope and norms of the actions within action research. It poses this work to take on direct actions together right now! Of refusing to be a part of, assimilate to and be quiet about certain politics and their violent relations!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After this setting up of a disobedient action research methodology I go on to discuss how I have taken up this methodology in three (ish) cycles of action and reflection, and how they have been approached at different intersections of social and technical infrastructures within and around institutions.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 10; transform: translate(-220px, 3120px); width: 621px; height: 514px; --canvas-node-width: 621px; --canvas-node-height: 514px; --canvas-color: 75,53,90;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="What was Actioned?" dir="auto" class="heading" id="What_was_Actioned?"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>What was Actioned?</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it comes to summing up the actions taken for this project they are fairly entangled by the ways I have been taking many internal and external arcs of research through a number of contexts. I have though found it helpful to map these arcs into three movements, which are themselves covered by each of the following three chapters. These stages overlap and have greatly informed one another, as well as many happenings that do not quite fit into this thesis, but I found this approach helpful to orient these movements more accessibly. An initial sense-making stage of inquiry into <a data-href="05_Configure-Able_Methods" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">05_Configure-Able_Methods</a> aims to figure out configuration methods by rubbing up against them and finding frictions with them from my crip axis. Through this I offer up the disobedient configure-able methods that emerges localised improvised collective configurations as affirming infrastructural and institutional re-configuring and hacking practices. I then move to practise these methods with what is in reach, and orienting towards collaborating with In-grid to figure out <a data-href="06_In-Configure-Ability" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06_In-Configure-Ability</a> as a place to collective orient our sociotechnical systems through critical access. This made room for us to try to distribute our capacity to manage and know these relations and in that movement also distribute the power and expertise in our relations. I also orient to try and put more disabled futures in reach by manifesting <a data-href="07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods" href="07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods</a>, where I emerge a crip network infrastructure and collaboration that aims to crip and disorient these sociotechnical infrastructures through bringing with us crip politics of affirmation, care, access and the indeterminate embodied knowing and expertise of disabled bodies.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even though these are presented as distinct sections I want to encourage an understanding of how these movements have come into being together with the figure below.

In my practice of ethics I have also queried these norms of the institutional forms of ethics, both in the ways they navigate ethics, but also how they template it for me to fill in. In this research this had been enacted by doing more traditional ethics forms for the <a data-href="06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_configure-ability_in-workshops.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a> and the <a data-href="06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> focus groups I have taken on, making sure they know what the research is, sign to consent, and have the ability to remove consent. In following these norms of course I have found friction along my Crip axis. One of places I have found friction is with the mandatory use of both ZOOM and Outlook, as being the ethical secure spaces for this research. This is because they are able to "stably" provide a service which fits to the tick-box regulations of GDPR, even with their fluctuating terms (Rob Pegoraro, 2023), and in doing so secure the stability of institutional contracts. Why I find friction is that Big tech models and tick-box economies that this research is trying to wiggle around, and so being forced to use them seems slightly unethical, and undermining. The unethical aspect also accentuated by the scales of these cloud economies, of the politics these infrastructures enforce when you use them, and the inability to orient otherwise in the inflexible hard systems. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This was particularly true when it came to how to document my working together with others, both in workshops and focus groups. Here instead of orienting towards these infrastructures which in many ways reinforce research as surveillance, where we document exact words in time, hold people to them and orient arguments from them, I disoriented to forming collective notes, of taking time to care for what people wanted to say and to manifesting an inquiry together. This move for me not only ethically changes how we engage with the communities we work with and the infrastructures we meet them with, retreating from surveillance norms, but also as a researcher with fatigue it has reduced my labour hugely. This reduction in labour also making the research itself more ethical for me to take, and also opening up critique around what we might have capacity for in research, if we are not trying to hold these people and their words in place. It also orients to the critique that runs throughout this research, that representation and assimilation in sedimented technologies and their naturalised ethics isn't always that ethical, and we can find other disobedient ways to disorient these relations to our own crip and queer axes, desires and needs.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This retreat from a particular type of individualised practise of research and ethics is highlighted in the way I have been undertaking my First Person Action Research. Here much like Marshall (Marshall, 2004), I have initiated focus groups with those I have inquired into working with. These have been enacted through a-synchronous collective reflections, based through my drafted inquiries and signal chat (groups), and where I invited feedback from others and room for them to add their own perspective. Orienting towards this direction has brought much joy into this research, as I reflect back with collaborators and companions on our times together, of how it has emerged into compounding reflections and unfolding actions. This felt quite vulnerable for me to do, and I definitely delayed and anxiously avoided it for a while, but it has also added much more depth to my research and made room for me reconsider my normalised and sedimented paths toward these inquiries. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">04.06.00_Ethical-considerations</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-6" style="z-index: 12; transform: translate(1129px, 3634px); width: 883px; height: 566px; --canvas-node-width: 883px; --canvas-node-height: 566px;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Conclusion" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Conclusion"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Conclusion</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this chapter I have presented the methodology that my research project has undertaken.
