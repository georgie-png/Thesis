# (¬_¬)/\` Serv(er)ing In-grid
In the Serv(er)ing in-grid workshop, fellow members of in-grid and I set up our new feminist server that is based with Servus in Linz Austria.  It was a very cozy day, we had a lovely lunch in one of the members houses in south east London. Once full and content we set out imagining what our new server could be through this exciting workshop.

The workshop ran for 3 hours and examined how we wanted to iterate our own [feminist server manifesto](https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml), in the form of the Femfester. Along this journey, as we set up the server, we felt out our initial server protocols. It was great to see everyone together, as we are usually in-a-grid online, working out how we want to use this collective infrastructure together. The workshop finished by posting the femfester and workshop notes online at [femfester.in-grid.io](https://femfester.in-grid.io/).  We are excited to see what this server space will develop into, as well as how we can take this workshop to other groups within our research and creative networks. The Femfester will also be published on Servus' next journal edition.
