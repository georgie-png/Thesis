# The Method

## Action Research

This type of research understands the value of practitioner knowledge as key to understanding a relations. In its process you understand the relations of the practice you undertake and through those knowledges can make future steps, and imagine somewhat grounded futures.

---


>"As practitioner-researchers we can produce our unique living-theories that include our evaluations of our past, to make sense of our present with intentions to create a future that is not yet realized. In the process of producing a unique living-theory, the practitioner-researcher evolves their living-theory-methodology (Whitehead, 2008) which is grounded in what Dadds and Hart (2001) refer to as â€˜methodological inventiveness:â€™"
Whithead - [Practice and Theory in Action Research: Living Theories as Frameworks for Action,](https://www.actionresearch.net/writings/jack/jwpalgrave2016finaldraft.pdf) 

This mainly looks like coding things, going to talks, thinking about how an algorithm/computing is designed and what it feels like to interact with, what it means to engage theory into practices.

## Disobedient Action Research

1/3 to 1/2 way through the PhD this developed into Disobedient Action Research. Where the knowledges of practitioners can take direct and disobedient actions toward how research is done and what it is able to do and be seen as.

---

>"Disobedient action research â€œinvokes and invites further re-mediations that can go from the academic paper to the bug report, from the narrative to the diagrammatic and from tool mis-use to interface redesign to the dance-floor. It provides us with inscriptions, descriptions, prescriptions and reinterpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along"
>Possible Bodies - [We have always been Geo-hackers](https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1158&context=ada-research)

This mainly looks like disobeying isolating your work from yourself and engaging the situated self into dialogue. Disobeying the dominant narrative of things, and forming your own. Making direct actions, and making real world stuff and change!

# The Journey ---\~~>

I was finding it hard to sum up my journey. so I decided to draw it up as a line that abstractly describes the different stages I went through and go from there.

# Material Explorations of AI

![[matterial.svg]]

I did, some collborativley, a number of material explorations with AI that i will v quickly show:

# The spiral of how we can work with AI ethically.

The critical reflection made me spiral when working out how to work out the violences of these technologies.

---

# The Easiest way to explain it is the cake of AI
![[cake.svg]]
This is a metaphor by LeCun, Chief of AI research at Meta, formally facebook, where he speaks about the desires and beliefs of how to manifest AGI. I analyse his diagram\*imaginary with Wendy Chun and Timnit Gebru research into the eugenic routs of AI. 

---

## To break it down quickly
 I will very quickly run through layers.

## Sponge = Unsupervised Learning = Subconscious = Segregation algos

## Cream = Supervised Learning = Conscious = positive eugenics

## Cherry = Reinforcement learning = Realworld learning = Penal Logics

# Do we like this recipe?

With the ingredients of the cake being a bit gross, do we want to take a bite?

# Queering the Line

When learning AI from Rebecca # Fiebrink's Wekinator course one of the key relations you understand AI enables is that it make the non-linear and un-logicable into linear lines that you can apply algo logics to easily. e.g. turning images of numbers (non-linear) into single float statistical probabilities (linear)

![[norm_cake.svg]]
But when we look through queer + crip theory, do we want everything to be a __straight__ line?

Especially through these eugenics logics?

---
# Situating In crip theory

![[crip.svg]]
This is when I started to get way more into crip theory, also known as critical access and disability justice.

---
## Why?

Cos I'm disabled.


---

## But also because . . . 

The Political\*Relational model that crip theory introduce changes the way we approach problems in society, as well as in our sociotechnical relations.

It also enables us to understand what working together through interdependence, affinity and life affirmation can be practised as now for the imaginaries we need for a future with crips in it. 

---
## Political\*Relational model

![[social.png]]

This builds from the social model of disability where we recognise that many of the disabling factors of someones life are socially constructed.

---
### Extend the social model?

It also extends it though to include the fact that some parts of disability cannot be cured by social change.

It is this refusal of a cure narrative that is a key generative friction in this model. It is where we do not hold bodies up to a normative straight line and instead ask how do we enable people and communities to feel out and practice their own relations of care that affirms those lives as they want to be lived.

---

## Crip Futures!!!

Part of this refusal of curing politics is to refuse futures that imagine disabled people not existing, often again through eugenics or cyborgism, and where disability often signals the utopia/distopia divide.

![[women-edge.png]]

Instead what do we do now for a  future where there is an abundance of crips? Where we don't offset things for the ever imminent cure, and instead make tangible changes right now!

---

## What are tangible changes though?

- Re-imagining how we practice together and with technology.
- Question + change our dependencies and how we care for our relations.
- Think about how we can imagine interdependence together as well as beyond.
- Practice and make safe mistakes.
- Open ourselves up to enable access both technical, academic and relations (social model).

# Crip\*Queer line

As Sara Ahmed would put it being open to disorientation and taking your own queer line.

# Cozy-Cloud

![[Thesis ðŸ“–/workshops/serv(er)ing in-grid/media/cozy-cloud.png]]
A crip infra made by\*for crips!

Inspired by Servpub setup, and made in a shit show of a residency (very abelist). I am just adjusting what it does a bit at the moment. But it also hosts a new infra poem work [en-crip-ing time](https://time.cozy-cloud.net/) I did with Mariana Marangoni.

## As well as Today

As well as these sorts of workshops and infrastructuring bits we have been working on. Obviously we all have our own reasons to be here, but with this work I am interested how being a disabled person and bring these politics into our collaboration can prompt us to question how we care for our imaginaries of futures and practice those coalition politics right now!
