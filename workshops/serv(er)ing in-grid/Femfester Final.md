# Femfester

#### Intro

This femfester is In-grid’s iteration of the [feminist server manifesto](https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml). As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how can we enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices.

A femfestering Server  . . . .  .

* Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices.
* Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair.
* Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them.
* Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties.
* Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible.
* Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish.
* Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice.
* Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics.
* Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. 
*  Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change.
* Enables networks and their practices to be improvisable and read-write accessible.
* Does not confuse safety with security.
* Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity.
* Tries hard not to apologise when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities.
