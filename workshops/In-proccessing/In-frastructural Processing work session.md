# In-fra Processing - May 21 - 18:30

  

## Intro

  

This focus group is to reflect on In-grid's collective organisational methods through a framing of critical access. The focus will be accessible to member's reorientation but it will be a time for us to look back and reflect on how we have started to configure our own infrastructure and background away from big tech institutions and towards feminist and intersectional community infrastructures. In this reflection I hope for us to articulate together through processing our inquiry, a few figures (metaphors) of our own to make accessible these situated relations. To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflex when working socially and technically. These will form contours for us to reflect on how we have enabled our collaboration to be in-flex-able together. This interplay being the place we form figures and narratives of access from, and where we as a collaboration have flexed towards accessible futures and away from institutional inflex.

  

## Agenda

  

- Go over questions for G

- Define together inflex and in-flex + qs to help us think through them.

- Feel out some topics or experiences to reflect on the inflex and then our in-flex-ability.

  

  

## Asking

  

### Inflex (missfittings / frictions)

  

What are the systematic and institutional relations that hold/held us in place? From Ahmed - lines holding norms of relations in place. 

- - Systemic issues around CAPITALISM aside. University structure, jobs/working relationships hold some elements in place, and enable certain actions. 

- - Institutions, these come with some privileges but academia/large institutions can be ableist, smaller grass roots organisations that are not driven by the logics of capitalism 

- - How we stay attached to these institutions or stay with the difficulties of systemic issues, but find wiggle room, how we make wiggle room. 

- - All the other things, like race, class, gender etc etc etc

- - Social and also contractual relationships

- - Time = money under the jobbing job world. And collectivising means we can pool time or labour in a time-poor world.

- - The Catch 22 of being able to prioritise art/research/things that matter for early career researchers/artists/makers is that you already have to have done these things to get the jobs/roles where you are given time for that. 

- - Post-austerity efficiency 

What are the things that disable(d) us from doing what we desire(d) in that relation?

- - Time, space, funding, prestige, brain space, emotional capacity

- - Dumb systems that's difficult to work with (Ex: No bank options for non- profitable small collective)

- - Working as a collective, that is not a business or a charity or an institution, makes it difficult to interface with other bodies. Transitioning from a group of individuals to a group that is legally definable?

- - Right to work, visas etc

- - wage labour slavery & and chronic health un-diagnosis that both disable/enable my capacity to do anything whether for work or socially, or towrds organising/meeting/ etc

What restrains/ed our capacities relationally and materially?

- - accountability to each other as a group

- - defining the boundaries of the group. intimacy / maintaining intimacy (is protecting too intense a word), while balancing openess. Project Grant Funding topics (not for this focus group). Maybe we need to be more strict about who we are inviting in and for how long, what the accountabilities etc

- - expectations from others in terms of availability/ capacity

What does this friction contour?

- - Wanting to be open but additionally needing some static for contracts and stuff

- - Too much admin workload on a few people when having more flexible form/ infrastructure

  

### In-flex-abilities

  

How do/did we process and feel out that restraint?

- Accept what works for the moment and being honest about the solution and the restraint

How did we (want to) flex and wiggle towards our desires?

What did we do to enable us to get close to the space/relation possible that we needed?

How would we have changed or approached this differently? 

  

-   
    

  

## Topics

  

These don't have to be mutually exclusive, maybe more starting points?

  

De/re-clouding.

- - Small tech-ing rather than divesting (cloud dependant). Not an issue with the technology more than how that tech is weilded

- - clumsiness

- - no one wants to do the boring stuff for free!!!! aka sysadmin / admin / notes

- - how to make maintenance a joyful and pleasurable space

- - tinkering with our own structures can be pleasurable

- - different social relational boundaries / rules systems of collaborating with other groups / institutions can produce anxiety or suck the joy out of the "boring" stuff

- - relational boundaries are helpful/healthy. sad as it is capitalist logics give a shorthand for boundaries between service providers and collaborators. without going at the speed of trust it's hard to jump into different relational structures. 

- - big tech smooths the edges of so we are choosing the bumpy edges

-   
    

- inflex:

- - lack of joy as default for maintenance

- - easy of use - hidden politics

- - lack of community

- - frictionless - no way of being in touch with it.

- - product

- - convenience in exchange for bad politics

- - scales can be overwhelming.

-   
    

- in-flex-able

- - interdependence

- - affective support as well as functional actions . . .

- - spreading the load of the "inconvenience" of using smaller grass roots cloud service. making room for inconvenience. making visible the labour of maintaining these services. 

- - choosing the scoping of re-clouding. picking collaborators (like servus)

-   
    

-   
    

  

  

  

Setting up infra / banking / organisation.

  

External coalitions / collaborations / working groups / bringing back and making knowledge share-able.

- sharing and bringing back knowledge is something many of us are invested in but the inflex:

    takes  a lot of labor

- inflex

- - anxiety + relations + penal 

- - lots of work . . 

- - no funding  support to do it. . . (unpaid)

- - needs personnel relations to share

- - mainly people with mainy things going on

-   
    

- in-flex-able

- - tic, repetitions, small scales of repetitive. 

- - patience and care

- - not making assumptions that people know whats going on

- - being generous with time and knowledge.

- - clarrity 

- - caring about pedagogy

- - clear refrences 

- - vulnerable

  

  

Internal politics and ways of enabling collective practices.

 in-flex

 - Scales of institutional norms
- - What choices do we have, how to work with resources we can access
- - Socially relating (differing needs and desires)
- - how we decide politics and who we align with
- - capacity for consensus . . . to what extend we delegate decisions or not
- - CIA's Simple Sabotage Field Manual LOL 

in-flex-able

- - Slowing down

- - love n care n openness

- - variety in decision making, bespoke decision making, intuition, trust

- - being okay with being uncomfortable

- - sedimented trust. 

- - let the chaos reign!!!! 


Distance/proximity/on/offlining

  

Membership

- too flex for insti - but a form that fits our needs

- three kids in a long coat pretending to be what they expect.

These are very quickly written sum ups, but hope it helps. Do add or edit if you feel they misrepresent or you have q's or other opinions. . . 

  

### My bits

#### Disability justice & life affirmation flipping the table

  

talks about my approach with Ahmed and Kafer to think about crip intersectional manifestings as a way to orient other paths towards life affirmation and disability justice. It takes the crip approach of imperfect manfistings that take practice and care, in their imperfection form bodies on horizons to orient from/to together.

  

#### Disobedient action research Methods

  

Talking about my methodology of disobedient action-research. This focuses on action research that moves beyond the scales of institutions and derives from direct actions into forming relations, infrastructures and imaginaries together. It also routes itself within first person action research, forming dialogues that entangle internal feelings and politics, with external actions and relations.

  

#### Configure-able Methods

  

This is a mapping of an internal arc of the research, and starts to re-orient critical access and configuration methods by brining them into contact with each other. In bringing them into contact I aim to see what impression they make on each other and how we can rethink access as a relational configuration practice and configuration practices as material/political processes.

  

### Influences for this session

#### Heavy Processing

  

(Cowan & Rault, 2024) - [https://punctumbooks.com/titles/heavy-processing/](https://punctumbooks.com/titles/heavy-processing/)

  

Talks about bringing queer practices of heavy processing social relations as a way to re-approach the heavy processing needed to start to imagine ethical, de-colonial and anti-abelist technologies. Thinking with it to how In-grid has our own sorts of processing, ones sedimented through relations of trust, in-stability and care.

  

#### Get the FRAC In (GTFI)

  

(Maier et al., 2020) - [https://cfshrc.org/article/get-the-frac-in-or-the-fractal-many-festo-a-transcript/](https://cfshrc.org/article/get-the-frac-in-or-the-fractal-many-festo-a-transcript/)

  

A crip manifesto looking into fractals and repeated patterns as ways to move us beyond the known and into a crip infinite. Here I am highlighting their focus on repetition or a tic we might have, recursively forming actions and relations. . . 

  

#### Wiggle room

  

(Sarah Ahmed, 2014) - [https://feministkilljoys.com/2014/09/28/wiggle-room/](https://feministkilljoys.com/2014/09/28/wiggle-room/)

  

(Pritchard, 2025) - [https://titipi.org/wiki/index.php/Wiggleroom](https://titipi.org/wiki/index.php/Wiggleroom)

  

Here thinking about how to reform roles that are pre-figured or sedimented into relations, whether gender, user, disabled, etc. In these thinking how we can collectively wiggle into these spaces, making capacity for the practices we bring with us and desire to be there as well.

  

#### Access Intimacy

  

(Mingus, 2017) - [https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/access-intimacy-interdependence-and-disability-justice/](https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/access-intimacy-interdependence-and-disability-justice/)

  

Talking about the need for intimacy in understanding the nuance and care need in access. Here thinking through our expansive intimacies in relation and forming infrastructural access, how we take time, know who might need what, and care for each other to be in that space together. 

  

#### Living Life as Inquiry

  

(Gearty & Marshall, 2021) - [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11213-020-09539-4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11213-020-09539-4)

  

This text looks into a reflection on first person action research as a methodology. It looks into how through situated inquiry and one that takes on internal and external arcs of enquiry through both personnel and systemic relations. Here thinking about how we can reflect through these methods to inquire into our own practices internally and externally.

  

## Questions for G:

   Q: how will data and anonymity be handed in the PhD in relation to any write-ups about institutions / relations to external groups? How can we be frank about discussions while also protecting the trust within the group?  Do you have consent forms for us as individuals around how we’d like the names of ourselves and/or our affiliations named in any write-ups or storage of notes / transcripts? 

   A: I have forms and information sheets I will share with you via email before the session which explain a lot of this. I also will share any writing up with you for approval esp if you are mentioned by name. All notes will be in this pad, but will also be stored in the cloud and held according to GDPR.
