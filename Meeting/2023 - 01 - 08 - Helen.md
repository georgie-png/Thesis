## Chapters ideas:

### IntroÂ 3000

### 1. Accessible Accademia, pedagogies of know-ability (working title)Â 5000

#### Personnel experience of problems with academia as crip neuro div

Problems with performative roles of intelligence gatekeeping "knowledge making" (a.k.a. writing/reading/speaking large amounts and in set ways, instead of enabling diverse formats (video/interaction) and styles to be developed into equal dialogues).

Academic conferences, costs, food, travel, stress, performativity

deadlines, segmentations of continual process

encrypted knowledge systems, finding papers,

#### experiences of being teaching in ways that made it accessible

Fienbrick AI course and wekinator

Helen and trans fem theory and socio technical systems

jo syches - functional errors

#### From teaching perspective :

Taught to present empathy through head tilt not care. 

Students being called mad, needy, sensitive, instead of their needs being recognised and their knowing being made able.

care, sensitivity and venerability being enablers.

subjective way finding, clear communication and relationships being key.Â - cs decolonial- pedagogies paper good ref hereÂ 

 
### 2.Â AI and representationÂ 4000

- Hall and encoder decoder theory

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - to auto encoders and latent space, Wendy Chun

- Nobel google rank

- How do these systems represent the world

- infras of cloud economies performing a very specific mode of production.
- How do these systems represent the world



### 3. Collective Knowledges (methdology) - maybe in conf methods 2000

Collective Infrastructural analysisÂ 

Working in groups and through collective methods

infrastructures are collective places

Sins intersectionality

what does participatory /collective methods how toÂ 

In-Grid

IP

Teaching

### 4.Re-sourcing (saucing) infra 2000 - maybe?


Poem or fiction of ripping out of the cyborg, how corp puts hooks into their imbedded/embodied tech, making it hard to leave. autoethnographic account through fictioning.

  

Making trouble, importance of action research to find the problems.Â 

e.g.Â 

Workshops with Neon showing lac of opensource support, trying to swap from cloud shows the pain it is to leave.

### 5.Configure-Able MethodsÂ - main bitÂ 6500

Lucy + sins + Kafer

configuring life? recentering where that measuring of life comes from

my essay

workshops

Methods not apps? protocols not mandated routes?

talking about how methods are more transferable than static infra, and how we refocus methods to more divergent places than a single app can go. - (i feel like theres a ref to this in crip kinship)

Interviews -Â 

use each ellement of practice to talk about ellements of Configure-able methods (e.g. what key 5 or so parts do they open up?) (julieta sing, deco archives)

#### working more with IP on projects + workshops: 3500

Modular Extractions

Re-reader

F * mnist dataset
#### working with Ingrid * Arebyte * Neon * servpub: 3500

workshops(obvs)

--------

pitching a server between the institutions as a playground, not to support the infra but to test out what infra we might wan

making simple but non existing Ai powered, decentralised, and free tools: 3500

e.g. speech to text + more

Teaching 3500

Maybe hold a hacker camp over a break doing AI etc.

--------
### 6.Able within the toxic rot, working out capitalismÂ 3000

Building from "This Compost Erotics of Rot" Elvia Wilk Granta + endosymbiotics

this is still coming to being so be tender.

Thinking how we are within these bodies (social/organic/techno/capitol) as elements within their organism, going beyond the separational ideologies of symbiotics, to realise our position-ability within their ecollogies/processes. This moves away from the notions of making something out of, both materially (making something from techno capitol infra), as well as conceptually (thinking of something out of the bounds of techno capitol infra) to imagine how we can make something within the rot we have inherited. How can we use imaginariesÂ  outside of to make something out of what we have?

mel chenÂ - on toxicity in Mel Chen Animacies -Â toxicÂ for whom?

###### Thoughts:
Loss as being the way we move through AI as well as neoliberal economics. In training Ai Loss is sometimes lost within a false valley, or lowest loss in one area, and this is where we have to open up this system up, to think about what scales of step we take with these systems, how can we enable a plurality of steppings, a cripping of the time frame and a way to imagine over another horizon (curves and the dip we are stuck in being the valleys)

### 7.ConclusionÂ 3000

## PracticeÂ Ideas:

#### working more with IP on projects + workshops:

Re-reader

F * mnist dataset
#### working with Ingrid * Arebyte * Neon:

workshops(obvs)

pitching a server between the institutions as a playground, not to support the infra but to test out what infra we might want

Solo (maybe with collabs):

access Extensions:

making simple but non existing Ai powered, decentralised, and free tools

e.g. speech to text + more

Teaching

Maybe hold a hacker camp over a break doing AI etc.

[[../../ResearchðŸ’­/Interviews]] with different people

## Timeline:

In 13 months (Sept 2024) hand in

Try to get a full draft done 10 months (April 2024)

This means 2 months a section ish? each section roughly 5K words (total 35k)

3 months maybe more to draft final ellements
