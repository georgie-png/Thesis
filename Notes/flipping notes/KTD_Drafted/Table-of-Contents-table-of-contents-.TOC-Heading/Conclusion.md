## Conclusion

This chapter has shared how my research is orientated through a crip and queer approach that aims to trouble the sedimented ableist norms of computing practices and technoscience through a disobedient queer axis of disorienting Crip manifestings. With this approach, the research works though a Cripping of technology, focusing on where there are slips and slants in orientation between normative logics within computing and those of a crip embodied and relational axis, and how these slips enable us to imagine and practise crip futures. In bringing Ahmed, Kafer, Hamraie and Fritsch, as well as many others, together in a crooked crip line for this chapter, I have formed a framework that aims to overflow from sites of friction. This is to not avoid or invalidate these disconnects and misfittings, but to think through how they can generate other orientations from a position of radical Crip intersectionality, interdependence and disability justice. Working from these crip slants, naps and f(r)ictions are places that can take us off the sedimented straight line of inheritance, break open the normative pipeline, and its determined relations, and enable this research to question how we want to approach relational "problems" we are entangled in for ourselves.

To reorient these tables and relational norms I focus on the Crip imaginary table as an axis of radical access, interdependence and coalition where we can practise and research other sedimentations of computing that move away from ableist and violent relations, and towards infrastructural politics of care and affirmation. This crip axis enables this research to take on coalition and of movement making as a key practice, thinking through how social relations of infrastructures are political technologies that we can coalesce (in) together. I focus on praxis and action, to entangle crip and intersectional theories and politics with how we can hack together our own infrastructural needs now, both social and technical.

Alongside the Criptych of Vingets, this chapter aims to provide fertile methodological ground for crip manifestings to be approached through disobedient actions and within computing. This methodology and its multiplicity of manifestings will unfold more throughout the thesis, but invokes a need for more digital network practice within crip theory, and their intersectional crip actioning through collaborations in and around institutions. This is to think about how we can foster crip practices and politics of radical care, but also to think about how these politics can overflow and emerge new lines elsewhere and for others facing efficient, white supremacist and curative politics. This approach aims to form collective politics that do not determine or prescribe protocols, but contemplate how we can become intimate with each other's access and needs as well as becoming the practitioners and knowers of our own (life affirming) infrastructures to gain agency at the tables we have always been present at, but were never allowed to get to grips with.

[^1]: As some disabilities are invalidated, or indeterminate within medicine, often leading to some of the most exhausting and painful experiences, that are still somehow invalidated.

[^2]: No matter who I am.

[^3]: "Adding ''orientation'' to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position." (Ahmed 2006, 12)

[^4]: "In a way, a queer phenomenology is involved in the project of ''turning the tables'' on phenomenology by turning toward other kinds of tables. Turning the tables would also allow us to return, a loving return we might even say, to the objects that already appear within phenomenology, such as Husserl's table, now so worn. Such tables, when turned, would come to life as something to think ''with'' as well as ''on.'" (Ahmed 2006, 63)

[^5]: "Disorientation involves failed orientations: bodies inhabit spaces that do not extend their shape, or use objects that do not extend their reach. At this moment of failure, such objects ''point'' somewhere else or they make what is ''here'' become strange."(Ahmed 2006, 160)

[^6]: Mine is often in bed.

[^7]: "Such an inheritance can be rethought in terms of orientations: we inherit the reach ability of some objects, those that are ''given'' to us or at least are made available to us within the family home." (Ahmed 2006, 126)

[^8]: "The straight line would be that which moves without any deviation toward the"point\" of heterosexual union or sexual coupling: any acts that postpone the heterosexual union are perverse, which thus includes heterosexual practices that are not "aimed" toward penetration of the vagina by the penis"(Ahmed 2006, 78)

[^9]: "*At the same time that we acknowledge this risk of universalism, we could queer Merleau-Ponty's ''sensitive body,'' or even suggest that such a body is already queer in its sensitivity ''to all the rest.'' Merleau-Ponty's model of sexuality as a* *form of bodily projection might help show how orientations ''exceed'' the objects they are directed toward, becoming ways of inhabiting and coexisting in the world."* (Ahmed 2006, 67)

[^12]: "rather than bend disabled bodies and minds to meet the clock, crip time bends the clock to meet disabled bodies and minds" (Kafer, 2013, p. 27)

[^13]: "The Child through whom legacies are passed down is, without doubt, able-bodied/able-minded" (Kafer 2013, 29)

[^14]: "How can i articulate a queer crip time that does not oppose queerness to longevity yet maintains a critical stance toward hegemonic expectations of (re)productivity? Or, to put it differently, how do i respond to the fact that the theories we deploy, the speculations we engage, play out across different bodies differently?" (Kafer 2013, 44)

[^15]: "\[W\]e create longevity as the most desirable future, applaud the pursuit of long life (under any circumstances), and pathologize modes of living that show little or no concern for longevity."(Kafer 2013, 41)

[^16]: "i read "under any circumstances" and hear "extraordinary measures," "breathing through a machine," "dependent on others." i read "under any circumstances" and hear "better off dead" and "life not worth living."" (Kafer 2013, 41)

[^22]: Full quote: "One of the hardest things to accept is learning to live within uncertainty and neither deny it nor hide behind it. Most of all, to listen to the messages of uncertainty without allowing them to immobilize me, nor keep me from the certainties of those truths in which I believe. I turn away from any need to justify the future- to live in what has not yet been. Believing, working for what has not yet been while living fully in the present now." ― Audre Lorde

[^23]: "Illustrating this with an image of a powerchair user wheeling against traffic on a street without curb cuts (1979, p. 153). This technology-enabled movement against the flow of traffic marks anti-assimilationist crip mobility: not an attempt to integrate (as in the liberal approach to disability rights), but rather to use technology as a friction against an inaccessible environment."(Hamraia and Fritsch 2019, 11)
