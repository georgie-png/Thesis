### 1. Metaphor preword 2000 :
Part of the collective infra chapter + modified with more focus on metaphor as a way of abstracting things away and around topics in new ways. Tl + Jas special edition, + more histories. ideas of figuration.

Leaving with a foundation of cosines as a radical crip metaphor for the research approach.

### 3.Accessible Academia, pedagogues of know-ability (working title)¬†5000

Maybe try to aforementioned the collective knowledge's chapter

#### Personnel experience of problems with academia as crip neuro div researcher

Problems with preformative roles of intelligence gate-keeping "knowledge making" (a.k.a. writing/reading/speaking large amounts and in set ways, instead of enabling diverse formats (video/interaction) and styles to be developed into equal dialogues).

Academic conferences, costs, food, travel, stress, Bodily and accessible gateways. performativity

Crip time and deadlines, segmentation of continual process

Encrypted knowledge systems, finding papers for ethics, on boarding into departments, getting finances.

deadlines, segmentations of continual process

encrypted knowledge systems, finding papers,

#### From teaching perspective :

Students being called mad, needy, sensitive, little fuckers, instead of their needs being recognised and their knowing being made able.

care, sensitivity and venerability being enablers.

Taught to present empathy through head tilt not care. 

subjective way finding, clear communication and relationships being key.¬†- **cs de-colonial- pedagogies paper good ref here¬†**

Crip time and care, not a phase but an journey.
  

### 2.¬†Automation and AI, a question of practice¬†4000

AI as automated decision making, and as that it takes on the role of choosing for us, so we need to understand/decide what decisions it should make and how. In the current configuration it is using singular ideologies to try and automate everything with. This motion in many ways based within surveillance capitalism from a route of racial capitalism, Creating a new market or territory to profit from the control and domination of technologies, people and space.

In this chapter I start to navigate the current histories and configurations of AI algorithms to start to question if we should really use AI, or where it might be suitable. 

AI in institutions still has a repressentation of security and military control. gs with bosh headphones, kcl with the internet as a primordial soup.

talking about how methods are more transferable than static infra, and how we refocus methods to more divergent places than a single app can go. - (i feel like theres a ref to this in crip kinship)

configuring life? recentering where that measuring of life comes from

workshops

Methods not apps? protocols not mandated routes?

### 5. Re-sourcing (saucing) infra

Poem or fiction of ripping out of the , how corp puts hooks into their imbedded/embodied tech, making it hard to leave. autoethnographic representations of 

Making trouble, importance of action research to find the problems. 
e.g. 
Workshops with Neon showing lac of opensource support,
going to conferences shows the glass ceiling of necessary academic networking
trying to swap from cloud shows the pain it is to leave

## 6. Enable the toxic rot, working out capitalism
Building from "This Compost Erotics of Rot" Elvia Wilk Granta + endosymbiotics

Silvia winter - instituting

this is still coming to being so be tender.

Thinking how we are within these bodies (social/organic/techno/capitol) as elements within their organism, going beyond the separational ideologies of symbiotics, to realise our position-ability within their ecollogies/processes. This moves away from the notions of making something out of, both materially (making something from techno capitol infra), as well as conceptually (thinking of something out of the bounds of techno capitol infra) to imagine how we can make something within the rot we have inherited. How can we use imaginaries  outside of to make something out of what we have?

###### Thoughts:
Loss as being the way we move through AI as well as neoliberal economics. In training Ai Loss is sometimes lost within a false valley, or lowest loss in one area, and this is where we have to open up this system up, to think about what scales of step we take with these systems, how can we enable a plurality of steppings, a cripping of the time frame and a way to imagine over another horizon (curves and the dip we are stuck in being the valleys)

## 7. Conclusion

## Practical Ideas:

#### working more with IP on projects + workshops:
Re-reader
F * mnist dataset

#### working with Ingrid * Arebyte * Neon:
workshops (obvs)
pitching a server between the institutions as a playground, not to support the infra but to test out what infra we might want

Solo (maybe with collabs):
access Extensions:
making simple but non existing Ai powered, decentralised, and free tools
e.g. speech to text + more

Teaching
Maybe hold a hacker camp over a break doing AI etc.
