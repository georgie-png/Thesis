## Iterating Configure-Able Methods

Beyond these different tables that I am moving towards, I hope these Configure-Able methods are generative for other to be taken up and manifest by them in their own contexts and through this hopefully troubling and disorienting them too. By troubling I aim not for this to be a final or cure of a methodology, but for it to be methodology to be iterated like Alison Kafer's faulty crazed manifesto (2023), or the Feminist Server Manifesto (2015) that are central to this research. In this I hope that those who iterate and manifest Configure-Able Methods in their own situated collective contexts. Here building up their capacities to make room around the misfitting and frictions they collectively make sense of to hack, disorient and make impact on the inflexible social and technical systems they come into contact with. With this I hope for Configure-Able Methods to open up the promise of crip access and affirmation within configuration by reverberating from the many indeterminate bodies, knowings and expertise that they can be impacted by, improvised with and shaped through.
