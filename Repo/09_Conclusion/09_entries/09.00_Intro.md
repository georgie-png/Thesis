# Conclusion

To conclude this thesis, I bring together the last three chapters and their inquiries. With them I coalesce together the many tables this researcher has been present at, sharing the frictions felt, impacts made and collective configurations manifested. I focus on how in these different localised collective manifestings of Configure-able methods we have started to hack and disorient the sedimented roles, figures and relations that we have inherited from our normalised network infrastructures and organisational practices. In doing this we have made wiggle room for crip and critical access informed practices within inflexible centralised configuration practices and methods so that they can be manifest and reverberate from the sites of impact, and by the people they are in touch with.
