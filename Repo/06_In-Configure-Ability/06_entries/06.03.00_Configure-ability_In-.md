## Configure-ability In-
These next two sections take on a closer inquiry into how Configure-able methods have emerged through In-grid's network infrastructuring practices. Our enactment of the methods here approach how these technical practices and their knowledges are shared. I initially approach this inquiry through first person action research reflections around our collective technical and documentation practices. I then follow this up with a in-ternal In-grid workshop as an example of how these methods have manifested both accessible social and technical practises to make room for groups to disorient and figure out network infrastructure as we configure them.
