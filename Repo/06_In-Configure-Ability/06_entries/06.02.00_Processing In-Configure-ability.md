## Processing In-Configure-ability

This section offers up a collective inquiry and reflection by In-grid around our longer term practices and where we processed together how Configure-able methods has manifested locally in our context. To do this I initiated a focus group and working session called *In-fra processing* to reflect back over these years of work together with In-grid members through the framing of Configure-able methods. This became a place for us to make room around/within and to trouble the frictions and inflexibilities we felt from our experiences of configuring these systems through our collective practices of Configure-Ability. This focus group was also run as part of the annual In-grid In-ternal residency to make room for us to query and reorient our approaches together as we went forward. This session was run as a very relaxed online call where we got together and took collective notes and reflections on this [pad](https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing). Here we initially started by figuring out some of the inflexibility we had felt in practice and from them recollected our collective practices of in-flex-ability in practise. Doing this we aimed to frame our configure-able methods and practices of in-flex-ability by making-sense of how we approached and reoriented the norms of these relations we came in contact with.
