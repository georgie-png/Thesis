### Defining In-flex-ability

Through this collective inquiry and focus group In-grid together started to imagine and define In-flex-ability from our experiences as a way to form wiggle room around where we felt frictions within the sedimented norms of sociotechnical systems. In this reflection on our longer term organisational practice we surfaced how In-grid has actioned our network infrastructuring practices, our in-ternal politics and our practices of collaboration and knowledge exchange by making room within the limiting norms for our members to have flexibility within their approach to this collective practice. As a collective we also took up configure-able methods within these figures and relations to think about how we want to orient our collective body, and in which ways we can make flexibility within and around these hard systems and infrastructures. This ranged from even just acknowledging that some things are just out of reach, and openly stating how we wished we could orient ourselves, but also to taking direct actions within the spaces we do have agency, like the ways we relate to one another as well as the technologies we collaborate with and through. In-grid's orientation of in-flex-ability in action makes room for us to not only acknowledge the systemic inflexibility to work around them in situated and flexible ways, but also to acknowledge how these systems have made impressions on us, and how we have inflexibility in ourselves in the way we can come together or make room for the unknown-able other, within our social and technical plans and actions.

This processing of In-configure-able methods and In-flex-able practice in action sets up the framing for the next section which takes a closer examination of how this has been collectively actioned in relation to network infrastructures, their technical docs, and the ways these practises and their knowledges are shared. In this collective inquiry giving depth to the understanding of both how Configure-able methods were manifested in this intersectional context.
