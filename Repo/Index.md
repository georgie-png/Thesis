> [!bug] Hello
> Welcome to my thesis portfolio!

This holds together the practice I undertook during my PhD alongside the thesis I wrote about it. This is all held together within a knowledge base made with obsidian. I decided to take this approach to the portfolio as I was reflecting on conversations with Creative Crowds (CC) around the Servpub project, and how they brought to the foreground the practices of their publishing process. Here taking a similar orientation I wanted to bring to the foreground my writing practice and approach to collating together thoughts and writings. These are especially important within this crip research, offering up the ways dyslexic and neurodivergent people can shape and hack their own knowledge making practices. 

This crip research practice has taken on a lot of configuring thoughts and practices through diagrams and what are called `canvases` in obsidian. By offering this up I share how this practice has shaped this research and how it has made room for me to bring together my different inquiries.


> [!caution] Canvas!?!?!
> The canvases are not very accessible in general, and I do acknowledge this, but they are what made this research come together so I feel they are important to share. They are not very mobile friendly, and work best with Firefox desktop browser from my testing. 
>
>To try to make them more accessible I have decided to do alt texts for them to try and share how they hold together the selected sections and entries.

> [!hint] Alt Text
> This is a canvas that holds all of the chapters and practice together in one composition. This canvas also represents how these chapters flow together to bring together this research. 
> This is where it starts at the [01_Introduction](01_Introduction/01_Introduction.md) and [08.01_Background](08_Practice/01_Background/08.01_Background.md), which gives an overview of the research. This then moves to link through to [03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes](03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md) and [02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table](02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md) which offer the critical framing of this research.

This is a smaller canvas that brings together the different groupings of practice inquiries. This is a closer look into what I did and who I did it with!
