Cozy-ish is the first theme for the Cozy-Cloud blog which ran on a [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org/). This theme was initially made to hold the [Cozy-Intentions](../Cozy-Intentions/Cozy-Intentions.md) as well as some docs for the early setup. It is made to be an accessible, minimal and Cozy aesthetic to host these intentions and information. It is an adapted version of Winnie Soon's [_Soonish_](https://gitlab.com/siusoon/soonish/) and adds a few minor edits to make it a lil more cozy.
