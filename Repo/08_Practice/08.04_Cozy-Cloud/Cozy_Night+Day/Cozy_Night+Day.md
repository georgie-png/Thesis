This is the current website theme for the [08.04_Cozy-Cloud](../08.04_Cozy-Cloud.md), and works with [Bludit CMS](https://www.bludit.com/). It is made to have be very light weight and network accessible, as it also utilises tags (as shown below) to activate screen readers.  

Screen reader code:
``` html
<article>

	<h2 class="mb2"> page title </h2>
	
	<p>
		by <span class="author">author</span>
		on <time class="dateline">date</time>
	</p>
	
	
	<div class="cover"><img src="./cover.img" alt="a cute cover image"/>"></div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
		Content
		</p>
	</div>

</article>
```


This website so far documents the work of the Cozy-Cloud and also is aimed to be a step towards making more room within this infrastructure for easier collaborations and exchanges.
