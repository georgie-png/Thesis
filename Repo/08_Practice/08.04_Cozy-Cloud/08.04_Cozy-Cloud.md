# Intro

The Cozy-Cloud is a crip centred server which makes room for a cripping of network infrastructures by bringing disabled bodies, politics and expertise in touch with these infrastructures. This servers initiation is discussed in much detail at [03.01_The_research_table](../../03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.01_The_research_table.md), and gives shape to not only why this room is needed within both research and computing, but also the frictions I encountered in trying to make this sort of room between these sedimented norms. 

I also go on to latter talk more closely about the work and collaborations I did with the Cozy-Cloud in the [07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods](../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods.md) and the formation of some of the infrastructure, practices and collavorations it made space for.
