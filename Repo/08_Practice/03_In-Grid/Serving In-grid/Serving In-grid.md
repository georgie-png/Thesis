These are the workshops that I organised with In-grid members and reflect on in the [06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops](../../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md) entries. In these workshops we set up our VPS server with Servus, as an experimental server for us to test and explore some different network infrastructure projects. In the workshop we made space for us to figure out how we wanted to imagine and enact our infrastructure as we made it.
