This was a focus group I ran with In-grid members that i cover the [06.02.01.00_Figuring_out_Inflexibility](../../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.02.01.00_Figuring_out_Inflexibility.md) entry. This aimed to reflect back on our practice through a scoping of critical access to inquire into how we had oriented collectively around systemic inflexibilities. These inquiries working through a few prompts and points of impact to question how in-grid makes room for in-flex-ability around systemic inflexibilities. 

Here I share the:
