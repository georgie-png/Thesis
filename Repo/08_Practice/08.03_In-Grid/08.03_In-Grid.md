# Intro

These entries share the practice I took on as part of In-grid collective that are reflected on a lot more in the [06_In-Configure-Ability](../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_In-Configure-Ability.md) section. These entries share a variety of practices from some coded visuals, to workshops, skill shares, docs and focus groups. These aim to make room to share how these practices have manifested my practice and critical access within an intersectional community.
