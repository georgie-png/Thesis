These docs are the ones I collaborative made with In-grid as part of the [Servpub](https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Main_Page) project that I discuss more in the [06.03.01.02.01_In-Docs](../../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.01_In-Docs.md) entry. These docs explain how to setup the back-end VPN and server infrastructure that can then host services like the wiki4print instance we have installed there.

For this research these docs are important as they are a place where I brought in critical access into our collective practice with the work of Kelsie Acton's _Plain Language For Disability_. 

Here I share the:

Reflection

These docs were very much our collective first attempt at writing technical docs, as well as doing accessible plain language writing and so I do think they could be improved in a number of ways. One of these ways is to have consulted a plain language author, instead of just referencing their work. The limitations we had on budget, time and capacity oriented us to be able to just be informed by instead of in contact with, but I feel it was a good place to start this dialogue within our collective practice and an orientation to move towards in the future.
