# Practising Protocols X Femfester Workshop Pad



## Femfester Intro

This femfester is In-gridâ€™s iteration of the [feminist server manifesto](https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit\_afterlife.xhtml). As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices?

A femfestering Server  . . . .  . 



- Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices.

- Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair.

- Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them.

- Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties.

- Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible.

-  Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish.

- Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice.

- Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics.

- Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can.

- Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change.

- Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible.

- Does not confuse safety with security.

- Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity.

- Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities.

## About In-grid



In-grid is a trans\*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.





## Practising Protocols Workshop Notes

In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!

### Protocols prompts 

These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.

#### Coding protocols:

Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be.

1. Doing things in pairs / groups

2. Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work

3. Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary

4. Be soft with sudo

5. Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. 

6. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk

7. Consider institutional implications for managed machines

8. Keep everyone up to date.





#### Writing SSH protocols

Here we logged into the server through [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake.  


1. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced





#### Writing sudo protocols

Here we approached the "sudo" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.


When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... 



Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to track



Should sudo be used alone? 





#### Writing user protocols

Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.


Not users but:

maintainers?

carers?

Member?

Players?

Collaborators and caretakers

it is nice to be individuals in a collective

characters

Conversationalists

persona

Infra as another collaborator not users/using

Fistulas 





#### Writing digital safe space protocols

Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server "sercure", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.


Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.

Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understanding

Not having knowledge lie with one person

Everyone should have ability to access knowledge

Don't make ring-fence around particular roles

How do we make people feel unafraid of making changes

But at the same time aware of what the "risks" are

Is it more about learning how to move with caution and care

The idea is not to move fast / gung-ho  / "trigger happy", 

but rather checking and double checking before doing

How can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? 

Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. 

Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the server


#### Collective working protocols

Here we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . 


* Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also

* Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. 

Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbz



### Femfestering

Here we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. 

### Free writing our manifesto

Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.

New things: 

    Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment

Does not police language, but reads intentions and actions




Form different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.



Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!



Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from. Creates security without insecurity



Rotting and mites and stuff.  Materially bound.



Is honest and reasoned about what should/could/can be achieved.



Can end, is not intended to be infinite or untethered from time.



Is open about material/fiscal/emotional resource, labour is explicit



Not geolocated but bounded/held in a community



Not 'for' one initiating purpose but allowing space for emergence of uses that support us



Consciously unassumptive about experiences and level of experience - acts of checking and rechecking in with community are built into processes



Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment



Is accessible not in the sense that it makes technology "easy to use", but invites all to partake in "difficult" tech practices, aiming to demystify "difficulty". 



Does not police language, but reads intentions and actions



Understanding that there is often no one route to the ideals(?) we are trying to embrace but that there are thorny implications and 'seamfull' histories to navigate 



Transparent about power and how it's being used





Notes:



* Opens herself to expose processes, tools, sources, habits, patterns (Katie was talking about this as transparency / accessibility) 

* Does not strive for ***seamlessness***. Talk of ***transparency*** too often signals that something is being made invisible (what is the relationship between seamlessness and transparency)

Seamlessness require a lot of labour and obscure the effort behind the scenes.



By making knowledge of a system or the system itself accessible, we don't need to make the system seamless? 

What is the difference between accessibility and transparency? 

Accessibility of sudo




### Manifesto alignments:

We then took the original server manifesto's lines and started to align our own with them, figuring out how we oriented in different ways.
