In the [Sentinel Self](https://sisselmarietonn.com/project/the-sentinel-self) project I worked with Sissel Marie Tonn and scientists from the field of immunology to produce this speculative simulation around how microplastics interact with and form tipping points within our bodies and ecosystems. 

The reason I highlight this project in the background is because it is one where I implemented a different type of intelligent or learning algorithm through the logics of artificial immune systems, instead of artificial intelligence. This modelling of these logics produced interesting dynamics within this artistic simulation, and produced different emergent relations. Interestingly for this research it artificial immune systems oriented a selection system, like immune systems, that centres diversity of output to approach the unknown, instead of refining a thin line of categorisation like artificial intelligence often does. To do this I developed a GPU computed multi-agent system that made room for 3000+ agents (viruses, t-cells and sentinels) to learn and emerge different relations together.

This was one of the more interesting configurations of intelligence as it both oriented outside a restrictive centralised narratives of cognitive intelligence, and towards intelligence and knowing as abundant and diverse.
