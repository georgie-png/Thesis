This is a crip infrastructure I made in collaboration with [Mariana Marangoni](https://marianamarangoni.com/) that inquired how we could make room for crip time in network time, now and in the future. It also questions the intimacies and care needed to not only manifest, but maintain crip infrastructures like these. This work was presented at Mesh Festival, as well as an essay about it published with Brand-New-Life Journal.
