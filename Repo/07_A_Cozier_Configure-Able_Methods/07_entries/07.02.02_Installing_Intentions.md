### Installing Intentions


To share these stickers on the server, I used a light weight content managment system (CMS) called Pico to serve them with. For this I also modified a theme by Winnie Soon called Soonish[^62] to make it more accessible, a cozy colour theme, and called it [Cozy-ish](../../08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy-ish/Cozy-ish.md). For the installed cozy relaxation space I also made a printed easy read version so that people could engage with them in a number of ways and not just through a browser which can be a barrier to access. To accompany the installation I had a set of cozy-cloud pillows made . These were very much real world versions of the clouds in the stickers, with soft shaggy fabric that you can hold and made room for another way to feel out, sense and imagine the intentions of this crip server. These different avenues aimed to offer the multiplicity of a crip server, both online, offline, and in touch with affective embodied ways of relating to it's intentions.

Alongside this I also did an early version of accessible docs to try and practice these technologies through critical accessibility. These are now defunct but informed my work with In-grid to make our [05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs](../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs.md). Here specifically orienting from how to make room in these technical dialogues of network infrastructures to be more accessible within disabled people (and everyone), but also more disputable by legitimising a plurality of embodied expertise within their configurations.
