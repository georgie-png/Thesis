dir="auto">In this Chapter I reflect on the intersectional inquiry I undertook into Configure-Able methods as a member of In-grid. This inquiry builds out of In-grid's slowly sedimented collective practices and aims to highlight how through first person action research and disobedient action research methods I have introduced critical access as a critical framework and practice to reorient our ways of relating to and coalescing tables of social and technical infrastructure together. It specifically orients how we formed technical practices of collective access that disoriented the norms of expertise within our  network and organisational practices and their knowledges. In this I aim to share how Crip theory and critical access doesn't have to be extra time or assimilationist, but can be a place to collectively orient from in the configuration of our communities and their infrastructures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To do this I am following of from prior chapters forming of <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md" href="../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>, I aim to go beyond that initial "definition" and move to feel it out in action and through collective inquiry. I do this by initially setting a background for these figures to emerge from, acting as a ground for In-grid's practices to be contoured and figured out from. I then reflect on a focus group I organised for In-grid members that reflected on the longer arcs in our collective practices through a framing of critical access. Here I made room for us to figure out frictions in these experiences and in doing so questioning the inflexibilities of the systems we felt. Orienting from these points we questioned how we had formed wiggle room around or within these points of impact through In-flex-ability. This is a recurring word play from us, where In-grid get In- to all sorts of trouble. In-flex-ability as we go on to define through action is manifested through  interdependence in action, and where we can make room together to distribute and move around these systemic pressures and frictions, aiming to move towards how we want to collectively orient ourselves. This framing of In-flex-ability is also meant to move these dialogues beyond the problem/solution axis of curative design practices, and instead focus on how In-grid address and orient towards not only validating our feeling around these existing frictions, but make room for that feeling as part of the sense making and figuring out processes of configuration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Working through this framing, I reflect on In-grids collective inquiry, as well as my first person inquiry, into how we approached these systemic inflexibilities through our collective in-flex-abilities. These inquiries then go on to take into closer consideration the technical network practices we undertook together. This inquiry resulted in the forming of accessible technical for the Servpub and Tinc VPN that I reflect on in <a class="internal-link" data-href="06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs.md" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.00_configure-ability_in-docs.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs</a>. From these we also emerged a set of workshops to make more space for these collective figuring out practices that we ran at 4S/EASST 2024 as well as internally, which I reflect on in <a class="internal-link" data-href="06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_configure-ability_in-workshops.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a>. From these In-flex-able technical network practise I reflect on the counter figures and configurations we manifested along the way, as well as the emergence into In-grid's first Feminist Server Manifesto, that we called Femfester and published with Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024). </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

In-grid's background rises from our emergence during a collective residency run at Arebyte Gallery in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. This was run by Rachel Falconner, Helen Pritchard and Rabecca Edwards. During this residency a group of 10-20 of us formed a set of skill shares and collaborations with artists and technical practitioners across a number of fields. This was held mostly online, and focused on people's fluctuating capacities during a very stressful and unpredictable pandemic, forming a very specific relation for working. We often joke about how this has trauma bonded us together.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Since the residency we kept communing together, talking and keeping in touch. It was a year or so later when the pandemic and lock down started to ease that we began to come back together and regularly work again. This was during the first year of my PhD and during this time we built up multiple collective events, forming distributed ways of working and facilitating outcomes together. These ranged from a series of club nights/events called <em>Real Bodies</em> beginning at Corsica nightclub, with many installed works and performances, to <em>Chain</em> at Iklectic where In-grid formed a preformative infrastructure that evolved over the night. Since then we have kept working together forming other exhibitions, infrastructures and skill shares collectively, as well as slowly establishing our internal organisation practices in the small bits of time we can be together.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Over this time people have joined and left, so we have balanced out to be a core group of 5-8 people and max 10-15 who can join in and contribute where they want and are able. These blury numbers may seem odd but they are due to our open door policy, which makes rooms for members to come and go as they need. This structure has formed through us orienting to make space for those of limited capacities due to work, life or health, as well as our constant lack of (institutional) funding that is common in community/arts work in post austerity UK. We also have a wide range of disciplines, capacities and approaches, from musicians to web developers and community activists. This brings an eclectic set of goal and desires to the background of this group.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another focus in this background is the 8M Trans*feminist counter cloud strike<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-a9f646dfe0c15749" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-a9f646dfe0c15749"><a data-footref="t1" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-a9f646dfe0c15749" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup> that we took a part of in 2021 and the years since with a number of different collectives in coalition. This meeting of many communities and collectives was also a major shift in In-grids desires and background. This strike focused on moving away from big tech ecologies and instead starting to invest our time, energy and resources into re-approaching how we can work with and for technical infrastructures towards our own collective orientation of them. These meetings formed the basis for our desire to not only question In-grid's own collective infrastructure but to also start to approach being in coalition with other communities.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From this background I crop into two different scales of inquiry for this research. Within these inquiries and reflections I aim to both demonstrate Configure-Able Methods in action, and how they are localised within and emerge from In-grid's dynamic and intersectional background.</p></div><div></div><div>

To do this I initiated a focus group and working session called <em>In-fra processing</em> to reflect back over these years of work together with In-grid members through the framing of Configure-able methods. This became a place for us to make room around/within and to trouble the frictions and inflexibilities we felt from our experiences of configuring these systems through our collective practices of Configure-Ability. This focus group was also run as part of the annual In-grid In-ternal residency to make room for us to query and reorient our approaches together as we went forward. This session was run as a very relaxed online call where we got together and took collective notes and reflections on this <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing" target="_self">pad</a>. Here we initially started by figuring out some of the inflexibility we had felt in practice and from them recollected our collective practices of in-flex-ability in practise. Doing this we aimed to frame our configure-able methods and practices of in-flex-ability by making-sense of how we approached and reoriented the norms of these relations we came in contact with.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

With these questions around inflexibility we touched upon many different aspects of what this term could offer to us. One of the major points of disorientation within our dialogues and definition of inflexibility was when I brought crip studies into this conversation. This was after members of In-grid joked about capitalism being the ultimate inflexibility, forcing our bodies into uncomfortable and unwanted orientations just to get by. In response I agreed, bringing this jest into focus with crip studies opening up the ways it critiques capitalism's invalidation of bodies and matters through dialogues of productivity, value and normalisation. From this opening up of crip studies and critical access, we very much overflowed with experiences and critiques of the frictions we had felt together. One clear example we touched upon from reflecting on In-grids collective organisational practice is how banking systems make no room for organisations like us, yet we need a bank to work legally and be valid. This dynamic in practice left us not only with a very limited choice of one bank to work with, but the one that remained did not really match our politics. This process of getting that misfitting bank also took us months to sort out through their dysfunctional admin system, and our part-time non-expertise capacities. Here we made sense of these frictions and how these systems had taken us from how we wished we could orient ourselves (e.g. having easy flow of funds held by an ethical source) to the inflexible position of having a glitchy bank account profiteered off by unethical businesses.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One point of friction around the definition of inflex came from whether restraints we put on ourselves could be understood as inflexibility. For example whether us keeping accountable to one another, taking our time and refusing certain relations or politics would be us being inflexible. Here I turned us again to this relational critique of access from crip studies, where the "problem" is not held in our individual bodies or needs being met, but rather in the social and systemic relations of politics that limit our ability to reach our needs that could otherwise be possible. With this notion inflexibility is positioned within the systems and their relations, in it needing us to perform specific roles (users), and with specific bodily figures and horizons (normids), to be able to be valid and approachable on their sedimented often inaccessible line. Reflecting on this later on though we do touch upon how In-grid, as our members work in institutes and were taught by them, have these systems and politics embedded in us, and how we have tried to make room to work through these frictions we feel in ourselves. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

Here we reflected on how we improvised other ways of approaching these places of friction within the sedimented norms we felt friction with. As a group we decided on which practice's frictions and misfittings we wanted to orient from and in which ways we wanted to approach them. This resulted in us making sense of in-flex-ability by reflecting on the inflexibilty we felt in our processes and practices of <em>De/re-clouding</em>, <em>Coalition and knowledge exchange</em> and our <em>In-ternal politics</em>. When doing these it took us a minute to warm up to this framing of inflexibility/in-flex-ability, but through this emerged some interesting points of collective reflection.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This topic's scope focused on our long term retreat from the norms of hosting our collective infrastructures with big tech cloud, to instead orient towards community and artist run cloud. This movement started after we had joined the 8M communities mentioned in the background of the chapter. During this transition we have slowly moved from a scattering of big tech cloud services to a focused collaboration of our cloud and network infrastructures held with Servus.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Some of the inflexibility and frictions we felt when moving out of and retreating from the norms of Big Tech network infrastructures were how as a product/service which is divided into user/designer relations, it meant that we felt defined to a specific role and body with no agency. To do this these Big Tech cloud infrastructures often put people out of reach of the matteriality of what they are using, and aim to keep the user experience, and the shaping of the human factor friction-less. To keep these infrastructures even more out of reach the sedimented norms and defaults of sysadmin and network maintenance is oriented as a burden, joyless and friction-full. It is also often only done by the isolated expert working alone or from a distance to configure technical relations for other users who are strangers to them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To form wiggle room here specifically we practised in-flex-ability through interdependence and collaboration. In this moving our scoping from needing to take on this immense burden that is out of reach of us, to instead ask what we have capacity do as In-grid, and what we can rely on others for. For instance, we as a group could not host our cloud infrastructures due to member capacity, experience and knowledges as well as a number of other reasons, so are working with Servus to host them. In this relation forming wiggle room around the frictionles user roles we were forced into by big tech and instead through the frictions of working with Servus, gently coming into contact with and making sense of the material frictions of network infrastructures, our needs within them and how we want to orient towards them. On an experimental server we have hosted with them we have started to form more wiggle room here by starting to host our own VPN and distributed network, as well as a git code repository (we are working towards). This orienting of scales, capacities and scope towards interdependence and coalition made room for us to not only move off of the big tech cloud, but also towards building up relations with similar communities and putting these capacities in reach of our collective futures. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This work is very much emerging for In-grid, both in the sense that we are only just beginning to work with other collectives and communities but also in that we are starting to do more things and splinter off into smaller working groups. Both of these were places where we felt we needed to make room for feedback and exchange within the wider group for these practices and knowledges.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The inflexibility and friction we felt here came from two points of impact. One was how we relates as a group and with others, and how these exchanges are handled. Here we reflected back to points where relations had induced anxiety and had a huge impact on our capacity for exchange. These for us often originated form relations where we felt like others were trying to catch people out, penalise them, or not open up relations on a personnel situated level without prescribing them to a role. This was mainly felt when working with other collaborators, but of course still existed internally. We felt that these sorts of sedimented relations of policing undermined not only our capacities to work together as we needed to constantly validate our position, but also our enthusiasm and energy for those collaborations. <mark>The other friction we return to is our lack of funding, and how this curtails our capacity to meet the many people and matters we have in relation with the intimacy we wish we could.</mark></p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To care for, feel out and wiggle room within these inflexibilities, In-grid reflected on how we try our softest to have patience and be generous with each other and other others. This for us meant taking time to share knowledge, make room to let it sink in, bringing clarity through repetition, not in a way to reinforce bodies and relations, but like a tic (Maier et al., 2020) when someone forgets or is lost we gently re-orient ourselves together. So when someones like "why are we even bothering with banking/cloud/coalitions/being here it seems so much trouble", we can again go over why we have chosen to put ourselves in awkward relations to practice in-flex-ability around these systemic Inflexibilities, but are doing this in a way that distributes and reforms these sedimented relations. It is when someone vulnerably turns up 2 months later and they need us to recap some of that time to be in-sync-ish. For In-grid it was also about figuring out ways of making these repetitions and in-flex-abilities joy-full even. This is still very much an ongoing dialogue and one where the many members of In-grid are slowly forming our own practices and politics that can refuse these penal norms we live among, and form wiggle room and social/systemic flexibility for people to bring their own ways of being together in our collaborations.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This focus offered us room to reflect on how we as a group form goals and orient towards them. In this dialogue we also made room to question what those goals currently are. It also has to be said that this was definitely the most fun topic to chat about, with lots of joy and giggles, when reflecting on these impact of these frictions and our resulting care for them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The inflexibility we felt here orients a number of matters. This is explicit when we question what is possible with limited funding, what we can squeeze in around work and what (if any) of our activities are understood as valid and valued within these systems. We also touched upon how we as students of these academic institutions, teachers and researchers within them, as well as within the norms of other computing/creative industries have inherited and sedimented the politics and norms of these bodies within us. Here we ask how these norms reinforce us to be inflexible in certain ways so that the contingent politics and relations we orient towards are out of reach. One example we experienced and raised around this came from both academic institutional norms, as well as ones of communities around us, and which oriented towards the ease of centring knowledge in individuals as it was more efficient than dispersing it into collective knowledges. This centring of practises and their knowledges though situates all the capacity to do certain things within certain people. Here by not taking on this troublesome task of distributing these practices and their knowledges the organisation can loose these capacities easily in doing so, through certain people leaving, becoming ill/mad/dissociative or passing. Beyond this consolidating these practices and their knowledges into an individual also takes them out of reach of others, and makes no room for them to know those practices and politics as a group, or the plurality knowings that makes room for.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In-response we reflected on how In-grid made room within and around these normalised institutionalised practices of management and collaboration that we have experienced. Becky and Katie surfaced a joke they have here about how if anyone needed to understand In-grid's methods and process, they should read the <em>Simple Sabotage Field Manual</em> (1944) by the CIA. This is not true in every way, we are not out to break our own things, like this manual suggest for taking down fascist states and their infrastructures. Instead when approaching collective practice In-grid is slow and we take our time, we are dedicated to working in large groups<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-a4949ce788136a64"><a data-footref="t10" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, have many misunderstandings<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-a4949ce788136a64"><a data-footref="t11" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, and lots of emotions to share<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-a4949ce788136a64"><a data-footref="t12" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-a4949ce788136a64" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>. These actions for us, and maybe because many in the manual were appropriated from anti-fascist, communist and anarchist movements are the many practices we have to come to decisions, build trust and get consensus from different members on our orientations. The many ways we orient this differently to the CIA manual of course is that the actions we take are done through love and care, where we aim to build up In-grid's relations, instead of weaponizing them. In many ways this shares how we do break down efficient management systems, but In-grids orients towards other ways of being together instead of replacing one fascist state with another. It is only through years of these relations building up that we have emerged the trust that makes room for members to take different approaches, forget what we were doing, and to be okay with being uncomfortable. For example getting our cloud setup moved to Servus took over a year to get everyone set up with account on it and for us to feel like we as a group knew what we are doing there. Still though there are some members who don't want to be on there and that is fine, and we have found ways to be in-flex-able around these points of friction so to not excluded them. In these ticing practices we build trust and patience in letting people manage their own way to reflect on and learn from our collective practices and their frictions. This demonstrates well our practice of in-flex-ability, and shares how we have wiggled room together within the sedimented and inherited norms for the flexibility In-grids member's need and manifest to be together within these inflexible systems and times. </p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

In this reflection on our longer term organisational practice we surfaced how In-grid has actioned our network infrastructuring practices, our in-ternal politics and our practices of collaboration and knowledge exchange by making room within the limiting norms for our members to have flexibility within their approach to this collective practice. As a collective we also took up configure-able methods within these figures and relations to think about how we want to orient our collective body, and in which ways we can make flexibility within and around these hard systems and infrastructures. This ranged from even just acknowledging that some things are just out of reach, and openly stating how we wished we could orient ourselves, but also to taking direct actions within the spaces we do have agency, like the ways we relate to one another as well as the technologies we collaborate with and through. In-grid's orientation of in-flex-ability in action makes room for us to not only acknowledge the systemic inflexibility to work around them in situated and flexible ways, but also to acknowledge how these systems have made impressions on us, and how we have inflexibility in ourselves in the way we can come together or make room for the unknown-able other, within our social and technical plans and actions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This processing of In-configure-able methods and In-flex-able practice in action sets up the framing for the next section which takes a closer examination of how this has been collectively actioned in relation to network infrastructures, their technical docs, and the ways these practises and their knowledges are shared.

We are a group of fairly technically capable people, and even though this was a new technical practice for us, it was hard to get to grips with what was going on at this table of network infrastructures. In reflection this was in many places due to the technical documentation and resources we were recommended, and which were quite abstract or incomplete. Beyond this the time/capacity In-grid had was very limited as it was mostly voluntary work at this stage and so it was a struggle to reach this dictated outcomes. The workshops and working sessions explaining the practice were also intensive and long sessions of terminal/console work, which often over ran, leaving everyone tired, discombobulated and unable to document or remember what had happened clearly. The formats of both felt fairly pre-configured and very rigid and did not make space for In-grid to have agency or input our background, approaches and ways of working around these sorts of frictions. Instead we were told "why can't we be like others", aka be quite and listen to/reproduce the "one best way" of feminist server practices.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Looking closer at the materiality of sysadmin as a technical process and practice it is quite specific in the ways it is made to be knowable. This practice for me personally has taken time to firstly understand and get used to the how the terminal environment works, finding handy commands, short keys and approaches that are absent from the very minimal void of an interface. The norms for this sort of terminal based sysadmin practice from my experience are written technical documentation which aim to act as references while you work. As part of our practice into this environment we started to make our own technical docs and as we came into contact with this practice, we started to question the norms of these sedimented approaches to configuring network infrastructures. From these sites of impact we questioned how these doc's formats made these practices know-able and perform-able in very specific ways and by specific people. Technical docs normally take on the form of text and code intervals, which often procedurally get you to run commands, whilst giving you little background knowledge into what is being done or why. A fine example of this is from an institution is Google's documentation on accessible web practices<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-1a5a728a8fc1bb17"><a data-footref="2s" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>, here they share does and don'ts, technical practices and share other resources that do help to make a more accessible web resource, but also mitigate any of the history or reasons for why. Their bland initiating statement "We write our developer documentation with accessibility in mind", orients from the start that they do not centre the impacts of access, and in doing so overrule the generative capacities these frictions would make there. When it came to the docs of Tinc<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-1a5a728a8fc1bb17"><a data-footref="3p" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-4-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a></sup>, the VPN we used, they are even less descriptive and just have code functions and commands abstractly explained in technical language and figures which are inaccessible to non-expert practitioners. Tinc's background and introductory information<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-5-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5-1a5a728a8fc1bb17"><a data-footref="1c" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-5-1a5a728a8fc1bb17" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[5]</a></sup> also isolates the scoping to what needs to be known to setup a VPN with Tinc, and gives little reason as to clearly state the orientation of this infrastructures social and political background. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Reflecting on Tinc's docs through Hamraie's flexible user (2017), I understood these norms of technical docs as highly inflexible and were figured and shaped for a particular body of the expert/super user, that not many of In-grid would fit without friction. The norms of these formats and the expected users they make room for hold an inflexible promise or set of (political) intentions of a specific setup, pipeline or approach towards network infrastructuring.  Being procedural dictating formats they prescribed expertise to specific relations, politics and figures for others to manifest their infrastructure through. Working with these standardised configurations of infrastructures can be understood as taking on the determined roles and operational metaphors of a system without capacity to question them, or be given space to localise, improvise and reinterpret them to local relations, desires and needs. To me this made me reflect on the ways that Miriyam Aouragh and Paula Chakravartty in <em>Infrastructures of Empire</em> (2016) discuss how infrastructures bring with them and reinforce the politics of the creator, and with this there is a need to question these inherited norms and make room for this locality when manifesting them. These norms of docs and their technical practices hold these infrastructures in space, in line and for most out of reach.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another key inflexibility of the Serpub infrastructure and these docs was the maintainability of its setup. This setup was predominantly based around the use of Tinc, which even though a relativley accessible VPN (compared to others) and one that comes from a genealogy of autonomous feminist servers, was becoming deprecated. This meant in many ways that any infrastructure based on these docs would (even if maintained) become obsolete, insecure and dysfunctional. This restraint to maintenance and deprecation crosses into all docs and infrastructures, but here provides a point of contact and friction to question how we would, with limited resources care for this technical infrastructural rot, and try to maintain the collective practices that go beyond them.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

To do this we coalesced these practices towards In-grid's own background and promise of collective access. The sub working group of In-grid members met many times together over on greenhost jitsi video calls as we often do to have collective dialogue.

Here we were also keen to inquire how we could form wiggle room for others to disorient and configure out these docs otherwise for them selves. In this move we wanted to question the expertise and knowledge within these systems, moving it from the isolated and determinate super users to chaotic collective in practice. In this motion bring a plurality of bodies into contact with these infrastructure to make sense of them from many points of impact, friction and knowing. This approach aiming to not just disorient the compliant technical expert and designer but to make room for the figure of a disobedient user who brings with them their community and context.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This chapter by Acton poses how to approach language, structuring and formating to re-configure them into more accessible plain language. This is not meant as a a reduction of what is there but a reinterpretation of how we represent, translate and figure these relations and dynamics to/with others in accessible forms. It is also meant as a way to open up different discourses, such as technical ones like these, to be within reach of the disabled community. In this approach challenging the scope of what disabled people (and others) can have expertise around, access to and intimacy with. Here informed by her concept we actioned this inquiry by firstly being conscious of Acton's principles<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-69ed567c55d3ee5d" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-69ed567c55d3ee5d"><a data-footref="53" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-69ed567c55d3ee5d" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup> but also thinking through how we can localise this dialogue into technical docs and our own capacities. To do this I turned to Acton's plain language version of Alice Wong's anthology of essays called <em>Disability Intimacy</em> (2024), which informed us how to orient towards plain language. We situated these alongside the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-69ed567c55d3ee5d" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-69ed567c55d3ee5d"><a data-footref="54" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-69ed567c55d3ee5d" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup> to think about how a Plain -ish Language WCAG (P-ish-LWCAG) might be oriented.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With this in focus In-grid started to reconfigure the limits of docs by trying to make room within their norms for docs to be improvisable and knowable by different capacities and approaches. One way we did this was by making more room in the introductory sections of docs to hold more information about the background of these infrastructures, and discussing what these technologies are and why we are using them in this infrastructure. We also made sure to take care of and cover the technical elements that the norms of docs from our experience would brushed over or straighten out. With this metaphorical curb cut in the introductions to sections, we aimed to form ways in for people to relate to these practices who had divergent backgrounds to the ones where these technical procedures had emerged from. In doing this we made room for bodies which did not fit that of a normid super user or expert and instead highlighted this misfitting, its frictions and points of contact as generative sites for that body to re-imagine and reconfigure these social and technical infrastructures. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Through this approach we also emerged our own syntax and formats for clearly signing both links and technical code elements. For links this oriented going beyond descriptive links to give extra short descriptions below them for people to get a better idea of what lay beyond. For the code inserts we started to form our own standards of how to make the technical syntax docs encoded more legible and improvisable. To do this in code exerts we highlighted &lt;variables&gt; with these brackets, and followed this up with how we had run them ourselves. There is an example quoted below. We did this to also emphasise the readers capacity to improvise and adapt these practices to the persons own local context. With this trying to make room to run them as non-procedural practices which do not orient them to a specific user and determined technical infrastructure. In this motion troubling the procedural deterministic norms of docs to instead make room for people to access these practices and knowledges through divergent disorienting dialogues.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">

These clearly showed how to setup these systems and would have saved us lots of time configuring out these infrastructures. It would have been sensible to follow the efficient "Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) mantra of course, but in some ways this repetition, or what <em>Get the frac in</em> (Maier et al., 2020) might explain as a "Tic", lead us to repeat the same stuff but maybe as plain-ish stuff. At this later stage we were also facing the fact that the VPN elements of these docs (TINC) were becoming deprecated. Feeling the impact of both of these frictions we decided to reorient again from the norms of docs being an active site to pose these docs as more of an archive documenting and make knowable this infrastructure's background.

These processes and practices of making space to reflect on what is being done and how, comes both from the emerging internally methods of In-grid, but have also had an impression made on them when being in contact with other collectives of Servpub collaboration such as Creative Crowds and SysterServer. It also builds up with Hamraie's notion of "design friction"(2023), centring those at the site of impact to re-imagine, redesign and reconfigure the infrastructures and systems they are in touch with. Through these approaches we dedicated time to caring for, feeling out and inquiring into the figures we encountered together within the configurations of these infrastructures. This for me personally was the likes of rubbing up against Tinc's logo (+@fig:tincLogo), an Apache attack helicopter, and being reminded of Isabel Waidner's <em>We are made of diamond stuff</em>, where the narrator questions the US military naming practices (2019, pp.&nbsp;18-23). This is where "They use words as weapons, they use weapons as weapons, and sometimes both come together in the Boeing CH-47 Chinook"(ibid, pp.&nbsp;22), but also in the case of Tinc and it's Apache logo, how private networks are often conflated with and depicted through militaristic violence and colonial dominance. With a decolonial crip approach I would also understand with Hamraie's crip technoscience<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-da38b5ca7b035dda"><a data-footref="51" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, and actioning how we can start to retreat these technical and social networks of privacy away from these sedimented roots of militaristic and colonial violence through community actions of access.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Tinc logo which shows a grey scale Apache attach helicopter behind tinc written in lower case black writing" src="../06_media/image1.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Tinc logo which shows a grey scale Apache attach helicopter behind tinc written in lower case black writing" src="06_in-configure-ability/06_media/image1.png" target="_self"></span>{#fig:tincLogo}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In action and as a group we also found members being lost from graphviz diagrams, maps and representations of this closed VPN network and leaving them unable to help maintain or know these infrastructures easily. This was mainly due to Tinc being both hard to access across In-grid member's variety of operating systems (OS), as well as not much time given by mentors to access Tinc from non-linux systems. As In-grid we had to find hacks and improvisations to work together around these limits, for example using Linux terminals on another OS. There was also the for ever forgotten passwords for the for ever layers of security that these zero trust network norms of domination entail, and which we were not used to accessing. Working within Servpub we also encountered more poetic, symbolic and figural naming practices of computational systems which made wiggle room within them to re-orient these systems througha background of feminist histories, language and variability. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">These configurings out in practice are often impossible to portray through not only a static set of technical docs, but also essays like this here. They are about knowing through practice, and by taking actions within and around the materiality of these technical and social infrastructural relations and to feel their impact on your body. Instead of trying to cure these inevitable gap between theory and practise, In-grid oriented towards developing workshops for people to practise these docs and network practices through configure-able methods for themselves. When an opportunity arose for us to share this work at 4S/EASST 2024 in Amsterdam, we went about thinking how to formulate these practices into the first iteration of our workshop called <em>Practising Protocols</em>. This workshop accompanied a panel we organised and brought together with other members of community groups and collectives organising community infrastructures, some from the 8M strike. This included Donna Halford-Lovell from NEoN Digitial presenting their community work around digital access, Julia Nueno presenting her work with app delivery driver communities forming counter apps to unionise and empower with, Femke Snelting from TITiPI sharing their Counter cloud imaginaries, tactics and stickers, as well as members of SHAPE talking about their work.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Bringing the docs into contact with this plurality of community politics, imaginaries, and practice, also provoked us further to make wiggle room for these collective differences of context, needs and sensitivity in these practising protocols workshops. The name of practising protocols itself emerges from both its feminist STS roots, but also through a crip understanding of protocols as a place to dispute expert knowledged of systems through counter protocols<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-da38b5ca7b035dda"><a data-footref="52" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>. In doing this we thought of how to trouble the centralised and procedural practices of infrastructures through making more room within the practices they emerge from to localise and situate this knowledge and expertise with that of the working group.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For this initial workshop at 4S/EASST we decided to crop in to the docs to a very basic process of getting into one of the Servpub autonomous servers and collectively editing a html file that was being served online. This HTML would then hold the collective protocols we made during this workshop. We did this as this conference has attendance from a mixture of backgrounds, but is predominantly not a technical expert space. This setting offered us room to test what it meant to make these technical docs and their practices configure-able to people of these varying backgrounds, capacities and expriences. Within these steps of, sshing into the server, entering TMUX<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-da38b5ca7b035dda"><a data-footref="57" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>, editing a HTML doc in Nano<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-da38b5ca7b035dda"><a data-footref="58" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-4-da38b5ca7b035dda" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a></sup>, and exiting the admin session together, we made room and took our time to question what we came into contact with, felt friction around and wanted to configure out otherwise together. This iteration and context gave us great feedback for how to run these workshops, with the final outcomes published publicly on the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures" target="_self">panel blog</a> and within the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html" target="_self">html doc</a> we edited live together. From this initial iteration of the workshop we felt like <em>Practising Protocols</em> were a promising way of making room for groups to configuring out infrastructures together through an accessible process that made room for their embodied sense-making and expertise. In this iteration and workshop session it made space for us to emerge with the group a dialogue around how these practices and processes were pre-configured and imagined through specific logics of servitude, users and bodily relations, and ones where we as a group could start to discuss and form our own paths and orientation within, around and/or away from them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This workshop and panel combined worked well to make room for accessibly dialogues around the technical imaginaries and configuration practices of network infrastructures and collective organising. It formed a context where In-grid and participants could question how communities and collectives come together to form their own approaches, relations and figures locally. It was also a fairly radical to do this with a panel of "experts", that was run by a trans*feminist collective, and with participants from digital arts charities, union organising and radical counter cloud imaginaries at 4S/EASST. This could also be said for the accompanying workshop that made room for conference members to not only access the terminal and technical network practices together, but to disorient them into a social dialogue in which we configured out these technical practices in action together!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was also interesting to reflect on how radically different the points of friction and reflection were in this workshop at 4S/EASST, compared to the next iteration with In-grid. This was of course because it was with different people in a different contexts and with slightly altered content. Still though it also shows to me the generative capacity the <em>Practicing Protocols</em> workshops have for disorienting the norms of network configurations by making room for divergent and situated dialogues that bring technologies in touch with and reverberating from the bodies they impact.</p></div><div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This workshop is a focus of this inquiry as it is the point at which I made room for these technical network practices, that were made know-able through smaller working groups on the Servpub project over long periods, to be brought back and made accessible and known to the larger group of In-grid. The scope for this workshop's actions were to do the initial configuring out and setting up of our collective server. This initiation of our network infrastructure made room for In-grid members to build up our technical capacities and emerge future collective and community projects from. The actions of this workshop were contextually quite simple ones, and oriented setting up our first virtual private server (VPS) hosted with Servus and in doing so providing In-grid members with their "user" accounts and access to these infrastructures. Along side this technical practice we also figuring out of our own iteration of protocols and intentions for this platform as we came into contact with it and made sense of these frictions. This simplicity of the workshop also aimed to make room to welcomed the wider group of In-grid members to this server space, and through this bring these network practices in-touch with In-grids background. Playfully I named this workshop <em>(¬</em>¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This followed on from this researches methodology, where we made room to collectively inquiry into how we wanted to imagine, tell tales of, and configure out In-grids in-frastructure together.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Fortunately I had managed to get a bit of funding from the University for these workshops, which enabled me to go up to London and do the event in person with In-grid members. Even though this was the case a number of In-grid members were running an exhibition in east London at the time, and so Yewen Jin who had volunteered to look after the exhibition asked if we could make it a hybrid event, so we pivoted onto a video call. In this workshop funding I had also factored in refreshments into this budget which meant we could eat and commune together before/during/after the workshop. This was important to bring these social, caring and joyous elements into our in-frastructure. For the access needs form I also made room within its inflexible limits to be oriented through pleasure by not only providing inputs for people's access needs and dietaries, but also for communal joy and indeterminate. I did this by asking what people's favourite snacks and treats were as well as for them to suggest music for the workshop playlist within this access form.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Sunni Liao had kindly volunteered their flat for us to meet and do this workshop in. That morning before the workshop me and Sunni had met up and gone climbing like we do together when I am in London. We caught up about life whilst we warmed up and fell off the wall many times. We rushed back to their flat to get ready for the workshop, and prep everything. Sunni cooked up some tasty food for us, while I got the treats and workshop ready. Other Members of In-grid started to arrive and we caught up and got ready together. Running slightly behind we ate as we began the workshop.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With Yewen online and the rest of us settling in we started to go through the workshop and practised our protocols as we configured out our server for the first time. Most members of In-grid, especially the ones who were present, are fairly computer and coding literate, with some having existing knowledge of server practices. This meant for the workshop, I could put more focus on querying and feeling out the protocols we were actioning, In this we made room within them to be disoriented by our sense making of relations and feeling of friction from our embodied expertise. To do this I made wiggle room within slides I edited down from the Servpub docs I discussed earlier, making room for us to reflect within each step of this processes, and orient from these points of contact. In each of these creating a sub inquiries into how In-grid would collectively figure out each of these protocols locally. These spaces of reflection are named in context of their actions and were made up of <em>Coding protocols</em>, <em>SSH protocols</em>, <em>Sudo protocols</em>, <em>User protocols</em>, <em>Digital safe space protocols</em>, <em>Collective working protocols</em>. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After this collective figuring out of network protocols I asked us to write In-grid's first collective server manifesto together. To do this I made room for us to reflect on the feminist server manifesto (Constant, 2015) and form our own alignments and orientations to/from it. From here we itterated into our own manifesto as a way to coalese these knowledges from this practising of protocols and its collective sense-making into the background of our manifesto. Here manifesting a server as we manifested its manifesto. The resulting Femfester manifesto with a small intro was then published in first edition of <em>Artists Running Datacentres</em> (Simms et al., 2024). Below I reflect on this collective inquiry and the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://femfester.in-grid.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://femfester.in-grid.io/" target="_self">notes</a> from the <em>(¬</em>¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ workshop to give insight into what we came into contact with, disoriented with our embodied expertise and made friction with when configured this collective network infrastructure out together otherwise.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

We questioned how we desired to work together on this server and what relations we imagined and planned for ourselves. Here we focused on interdependence, on doing things in pairs, keeping people in-sync and making room for a-sync processes. We also focused on working slowly, being soft, and double, no triple checking before we do things. There was also a focus on documentation, not only as a way of keeping people in-sync, but also as a way to roll back or undo decisions and actions (where possible).</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This is the first point that we came into contact with the server, and SSH configures the way we can connect, interface and be intimate with our server. There is little written feedback in the workshop notes on the pad, apart from "1. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced". This is partially as we were still warming into collective note taking, but this note leads from a conversation we had about the embedded metaphor and figure of SSH as a hand shake. Within this conversation we opened up dialogues around the figures we want to replace. Instead of a handshake which reinforces able bodiedness within a normid user and with that the hierarchical relation and inaccessible contract making between particular kinds of bodies (white men). Here we started to imagine what metaphors we wanted to configure our relations to our infrastructure through. This particular friction did not generate any outcomes of counter figures, unlike others latter on, as I feel we may have still been warming into the process.  It did though open up this dialogue of how we wanted to move towards other figures of our own. We wanted to find a practice and relation where we do not negate or hide these histories in our retreat from them, but disorient their bodies and relations through the impression of our retreat.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This is needed to do most of the admin tasks on a server as it gives you the rights to do so. Here we found friction with this sort of responsibility and expertise being individualised to specific "super" users and that imagined body. In response to this we turned to orient around interdependence as a way to not only slow each other down and see things from a number of perspectives but to hold each other response-able through our distributed expertise. We also questioned how we could do this, asking questions like "can we track who is doing what as sudo?" Instead in conversation In-grid turned to questions of how we as a group could not formalise trust through security, tracking, etc., but through social technologies of interdependence, moving to further build trust between us socially, instead of solely through our technical systems.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

These user accounts are the ones that each of us access the server through and as a configuration orients the singular standardised individualised user on a device. Here was a very generative space for forming our own counter figures and found much joy in configuring ourselves, our roles and how we wanted to relate to each other on this server. In the reflective room around this point of contact we opened up a dialogue of how we desired to disorient the norms and sedimented relations that the figure of the <em>User</em> represents. Instead of users, which pull from eugenics histories and imagine a particular normid body (Hamraie, 2017), and servers, which emerge from traditions of hidding labour (Krajewski &amp; Iurascu, 2018), collectively we started to imagine how we wanted to orient our relations in this room. To figure this out we spent time chatting and writing up these imagined roles together. This configure-able room around roles emerged them within In-grid's locality as maintainers, carers and caretakers of this infrastructure, but also personas, players and characters. These all also oriented towards this server and our infrastructure being a collaborator in our collective, moving it from a normalised user/using hidden servers relationship, to one oriented towards mutual care.

This meant that only a person on a device with that key and its password can access that user on that server, making it "secure". This is the standard or "norm" of security for a server with a public IP like this, and realistically does keep this space "safe" within the materialised military imaginaries of a zero trust encryted web that we exist in today (Spencer &amp; Pizio, 2024). This relation became a place we found friction within these infrastructural inflexibilities that left In-grid asking what other imaginaries of safety and privacy could we imprint on our server from our background. Here I think influenced by the feminist server manifesto we talked a lot about transparency. We discussed how transparency even though performs the making visible of dynamics, is in many ways a barrier in place that is there to make a system "secure" from intervention. In this performance of transparency is also the filtering and orienting of these material practices and their background into the abstract languages and representative figures that form the knowledge of experts. Instead we started to ask how we could disorient these sedimented relations of security and transparency through critical access. In our notes this is highlighted by the desire to not "ring-fence around particular roles" or their knowledges, and the need to not have "knowledge lie with one person". With these statements refusing this figure of the expert user, and orienting to community and collective knowledges. To do this we thought about how safety for us is not about static barriers of security or hierarchical roles that reinforce each other, but to be intimate with who we are with and what we are doing. From this discussion our safety comes then not from a checklist, keys charters or generalised deterministic set of conditions, but from taking time to build trust by making room for each other to form dialogues and exchanges in-flex-able ways. Within network practices this was particularly relevant, as we did not want each other to be intimidated (by the already intimidating technology), so forming relations of trust that centred access of these technologies was key. We came up with many protocols and practices for achieving this, from again working in pairs/groups, researching/checking/quadruple-checking before we took actions, and collectively demystifying these systems to all be experts on what these protocols and technologies are to us all. </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

This sounds very complicated, but basically lets you work collaboratively within one terminal together and is used for collective server work. I wanted to bring this collaborative interface into focus as it does have many restraints and frictions for collaborative working. These range from basic things like classic obscure terminal copy and paste commands, but also that there is only one person able to write at one time, and the possibility of accidentally loosing sessions by typing exit (even in another command). In the pad and session though the reflections focus mainly on technical elements of TMUX as the limits above gave us a few technical issues members couldn't quite get beyond. We were also running a little out of time so decided to move on from this and to focus on writing the manifesto together. Reflecting on this brief contact though, it was interesting to see how collaboration in these technologies is configured through very restrictive relations, and when a group like us, who collaborate in a number of dynamics and approaches, found this pre-configured relation too tight and misfitting to our needs. In-grid was definitely not the imagined expert users of TMUX, but being in touch with these constrained collaborative environments showed us how much these relations needed us to form wiggle room within them.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

To do this we talked as a group about how we wanted to orient our approach to this. To start this off In-grid members chatted about what the <em>Feminist Server Manifesto</em> (Constant, 2015) meant to them, and what they thought of it, with members being excited for us to take on iterating our own version as it had been an inspiration to members of the group. We decided that a collective reading of the original <em>Feminist Server Manifesto</em> would be a nice way to initiate this, and then follow it up by commenting on, iterating through and figuring out our own manifesting of it. In this reading we took turns to read lines in non-hierarchical and improvised form with members dynamically taking up where others left off, and echoing back to earlier collective reading practices and performances In-grid has done<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-9ed25dfdfe494a57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-9ed25dfdfe494a57"><a data-footref="59" href="06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-9ed25dfdfe494a57" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">We followed this up by doing another In-grid practice of synchronous free writing in a shared pad. This is a practice we have emerged that makes room for members to anonymously let ideas and thoughts out, making it a very relaxed way to start ideation and get a feel of how the group is oriented. After this free writing we started to form alignments with the manifesto by writing out the original lines, talking through them and figuring out how "our lines" oriented from theirs. We only had time to go through half of them in the session, as people had time constraints, but here again we were in-flex-able around this. To do this we turned to an a-sync work flow where we wrote on the etherpad and online. Through this process of reorienting the manifesto and feeling out a few points where we wiggled from their path. Here we re-oriented many of these issues through critiques and figures of access, asking how we as a group can imagine and materialise these approaches in our network practices. This ranged from caring for the frictions of accessing a server collectively, to making room for those difficulties to be knowable and accessible by others. In this orientation we formed our own impact centred critical access informed dialogues and practices that disoriented "transparency". In-grid's central figure of reorientation of this emerged from our dedication to interdependence as a pivotal to our manifesting. The original <em>Feminist Server manifesto</em> does clearly come from community and a place of interdependence, but we wanted to emphasise interdependence as the figure that made room for In-grid's manifesting. In this move we also reoriented from not apologising for not being available (all the time), to learning to communicate our capacities and feel out and take care around our limits, both individual/collective. This for me also opens this manifesting to being a practice that changes over time, and one that aims to not only reveal but also build up our capacities within relation. We did in many places not wiggle from the original manifestos path though, finding alignment in the refusal of security, of exposing insecurities and avoiding ease-of-use. Again though we found it important to reaffirm these moves through abolitionist concepts and wordings. Over the next week or two we worked together asynchronously to edit and finesse together this manifesto, along with a short intro, for publication with Servus and the first edition of their <em>Artists Running Datacentres</em> journal (Davide Bevilacqua, 2024). Here it was engulfed in a further plurality of research, interviews and practitioner knowledges from across Servus' community. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This manifesto aligns with the provocation of the original Feminist sever manifesto (ibid), as well as with this researches approach of flawed and crazed crip manifesting (Kafer, 2017, 2023). This is where in its essence, the Femfester not only makes space for itself to be more crazed, poetic and visceral but also yearns to be iterated through its misfitting in action, and frictions made and felt within complex systems and configurations of community infrastructures. </p></div><div></div><div>

This entangle set of inquiries made room for In-grid (and I) to take configure-able methods up and to not only practice but also process and configure out locally the manifestation of our collective  infrastructures. Reflecting more closely on the outcomes of the multitude of outcomes, I think it worked well as a method to wiggle room within these technical practices through critical access informed disobedient collective interventions of expertise. In-grid here taking our sweet time to form collective imaginaries from our background and through these direct actions. With these actions making room for our embodied situated knowledges as a group to disorient how we want to configure these social and technical reltions of network infrastructure and collective organising from their sites of impact. For me these inquiries into in-configure-ability, it has  emerged as a methodology and practice for In-grid to challenge the norms and sedimented relations of security politics we have inherited through our own disobedient politics and figures of collective access. To do this we retreated from these norms and turned to social practices of forming community trust, interdependence and care. With this movement we aimed to retreat from the myths and figures of security and transparency, to instead orient to that of critical access as a way to distribute the knowing and expertise throughout a group, instead of having it transparently figured out for them.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>
