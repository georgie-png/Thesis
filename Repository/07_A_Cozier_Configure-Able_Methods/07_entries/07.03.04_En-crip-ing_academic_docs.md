### En-crip-ing academic texts - plane -ish text inverted

This section reflects back to [05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs](../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs.md), and the way In-grid and I made wiggled room with sedimented formats, roles and centralisation of technical expertise. Working with Kelsie Acton's Semi-Plain language (2023), In-grid and I did this so that these docs were not only accessible from different approaches and capacities, but to also distribute the expertise of these social and technical infrastructures. In the accompanying essay to the En-crip-ing time infrastructure/artwork, called *En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&with a SexCI Chronic Job* (2025), Mariana and I inquired into how we could similarly approach the sedimented formats of academic essays and practice to wiggle room into their sedimented code, practices and capacity to manifest this crip infrastructure. Doing this we disoriented these technologies as a way to crip these individualises relations of practice and theory, plan and action, paper and code, to not divided them but make room to coalesce them together at one table. This was in a very playful, poetic and joyful expression of how these two complex institutionally configured formats of technical docs and academic texts can meet. Here figuring out what impression these two discipline make upon one another when in touch. In this contact we manifested room for these bodies to form questions around what kinds of variability they need both to be in touch.
