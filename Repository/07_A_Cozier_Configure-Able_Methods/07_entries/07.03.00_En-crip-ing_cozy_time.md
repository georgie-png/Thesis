## En-crip-ing cozy time

This section covers both the first collaboration through/on/with the Cozy-Cloud, but also the first overt cripping of the the Cozy-Cloud server's infrastructure. This collaboration was with Mariana Marongoni[^r8] who is a Brazilian transdisciplinary artist, web developer, and researcher based in London. In her work she critically explores media materiality and the aesthetics of decay through installations, web-based experiments, and visual poetry. This collaboration emerged through many bumping intos of each other through our PhD research, going to events, conferences and workshops. In these spaces we were crip buddies, chatting, helping each other out, complaining about how tired/fatigued we were. From these mainy encounter with a lack of access we emerged a desire/need to try cripping these relations we were impacted by a little. From this we started to come together to figure out how we could interdependently crip the Cozy-Cloud server and the ableist norms of computing through our own embodies expertise and knowledges. These initial conversations from us turned into the work/infrastructure *En-crip-ing time* which was presented at Mesh festival in Basel[^r9], and accompanied by a published essay *En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&with a SexCI Chronic Job* (Simms & Marangoni, 2025).
