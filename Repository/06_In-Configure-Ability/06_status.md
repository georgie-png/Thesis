# Notes

in-configre-ability

Start with what is at stake, as is way too comple. try to not reinterpate words too much (simplify)- use some of the things you say about In-grid at the begin of the chapter, to situate your work and to introduce where the inspiration of generating concepts such as in-flex is coming from

maybe do a 1. 2. 3. of what I am doing.

intro with confiure out, then move to defining figures of (inflex and in-flex)

Might restructure to put in-proccessing first and definitions -> then move into the docs and workshoping?

Also defs of inflex and in-flex might need to be re approached? or better defined?

this is not ethno, more about showing methods.

give methods - how the workshop was documented and what materials you reflect from and how they are used in the chapter to reflect on the practice of generating these figures ...focusing on collective practice and orientation not so much specific peoples words?

Reclaiming but what does that mean? Wht contexts are we taking them from.
