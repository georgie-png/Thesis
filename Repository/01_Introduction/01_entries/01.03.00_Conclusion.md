## Conclusion 

This thesis and its inquiries go on to shape in action what Configure-able methods can be in these localities. With these inquiries into Configure-able methods in action I ask how can they make room for us to orient from the site of impact within configuration? How can we not only stay with the frictions that disorient our plans but care for the impact we can make around them? And how can we centre crip theory and critical access not only in the ways that we can organise and care for our communities, but the ways this can impact and shape the configurations of these hard systems to orient them toward being the life affirming infrastructures we know we need now!??!?!?!
