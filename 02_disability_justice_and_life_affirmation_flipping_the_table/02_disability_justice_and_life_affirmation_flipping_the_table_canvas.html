class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To queer this sedimented straightening axis, Ahmed starts by tracing the etymology of "queer". Queer in a spatial context means a twist in space, and when we combine this with definitions of sexual orientation, it poses a bent, deviant or crooked sexuality. Ahmed starts to queer the straight line to make wiggle room to thinking about how to approach relations on this horizon. If we are to move straight towards an object, as a singular other from determinate positions, then we can only take a straight path towards it<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-b246cf2558207a35"><a data-footref="x8" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. She demonstrates this at the dining table where one man sits opposite one woman. This emerges into the family table where we have set sides and positions. Ahmed shows how this line straightens out a queer or crooked one by pushing us to choose one side of the table. Ahmed questions how the queer line is portrayed as oblique when held against the straight line, even posing that the straight line needs the queer one against which to appear comparatively straight. Ahmed reorients this idea through her figure of the "contingent lesbian" (Ibid, 92), which queers Freud's notion of a "contingent introvert", who positions queerness as a lack of finding a partner of the other sex, and so turns to her own by default. Ahmed inverts this relation to position straightness as contingent, and sees lesbians not as defaulting to queerness in the lack of a suitable person of the other sex, but defaulting to straightness and the other sex when the familial line and sedimented straight norms put queer bodies out of reach. Here she is thinking about this not as a "coming out" as queer or lesbian but as "coming to" queerness through desire. This reorients these relations towards queer desire and away from the "requirement" of a straight line. This makes room for me to understand how I approach the world along my own crooked or deviant lines that take me towards different people, communities, relations and in doing so shape my body and sediment my own paths.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Key to this critique is a queer reading of Merleau-Ponty's "sensitive body"<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-b246cf2558207a35"><a data-footref="x9" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup> where Ahmed reflects on how inhabiting space produces a space to be inhabited. For example, a soft bottom creates a softer seat, that creates a softer bottom and softer seat. This concept is used to figure how a queer twist in the straight line of inheritance is itself conducive to forming a line that has room and capacity to be twisted. To think this through, she takes up the butch-femme dynamic of lesbian relations, and critiques not only the hetero perception of needing sexual difference or an opposite to attract but also queer critiques like Joan Nestle's "phony heterosexual replicas" that mimic this. With the help of Judith Butler she poses that the real need here is to question the necessity for difference in queer attraction, of the "requirements" of desire and relations. Ahmed instead positions these roles as performances as "erotic possibilities that can generate new lines of desire only when they are just that: possibilities rather than requirements" (Ibid, 99). In doing this she is opening up the possibility for bodies to not be determined by set relations but to be things to be desired, pursued, subverted and felt out. In this move she plays on lesbian fictions of Butch-Butch relations within Leslie Feinberg's <em>Stone Butch Blues</em> as well as Lee Lynch's <em>The Swashbuckler</em>, to show the comical navigation of desire of self within lesbian culture. She turns here though to state that these performed lines and bodily horizons of butch-femme are not illegitimate, but cautions against drawing "a dividing line" that can in itself "make other forms of sexual desire unlivable"(Ibid, 99). In this research, I have been playing with these ideas around queer relations in the context of wider intimacies, from how roles such as users and experts are performed with digital network infrastructures, to the emerging of indeterminate collaborative and collective desires.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ahmed takes Merleau-Ponty's notion of the "sensitive body" to discuss how this "coming to" queerness shapes and forms our bodies through being in relation with and touching other queer bodies. She explains how being oriented towards other women doesn't just shape our sexuality, but also what other objects are reachable on our horizon. She shares how queer and lesbian desires move us sideways, taking us to different associations and connections that are often invisible to others. As I follow my own queer path she encourages the refusal of this straightening up, to not look back or reorient ourselves to/around straight heckles, however offensive they are, and to instead orient towards my own queer promise. This queering of the axis is to stay disoriented, to orient into possibilities that straight lines could never map, and to touch and hold our bodies in our own economies. A queer axis is one where the horizontal and vertical lines of inheritance don't always "line up", can be "off line", and challenge the sedimentations that hold me in place, force me to one side and keep me out of reach of me needs and desires.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Removing the "holding" things in place, in this research when I move this metaphorical tracing paper to other tables and relations; the grooves in these different tables inducing a queering that animates these sedimented lines to be drawn otherwise. This means that if I take a seat at institutional tables as a crip and queer<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-b246cf2558207a35"><a data-footref="x10" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-b246cf2558207a35" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>, even if it isn't orientated, approachable or stable to me, I am mutually affecting it. It means that when I bring myself, my thoughts and research to other queer tables, of coalition and of crip care, I can be comfy in our shared disorientation at hegemonic tables. The research I am doing gets slanted with my body to my other queerer axes. When I come to institutional tables along these queer axes, I take them off balance, grasping at them and nudging them to an orientation I need. This is a very queer dance that begins to happen when I refuse to be held in place, or hold other things out of place. I start to be able to be flexible in how I orient myself, begin to be able to feel my needs and to form tables and relations of affinity that feel mutual, constitutive and affective.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

This move changes the scoping from a generalised and centralised dictation of direction that wider modernist philosophy denotes, to a situated and relational navigation of bodies. She does this by queering Husserl's figure of a table, his orientation towards it and his knowing of what is behind him as he does so (Ibid, 29). To do this she positions his back, and backgrounding of things, as the point of deviation that a queer phenomenology takes up in its analysis. At this inversion of direction and position sits the ability to wonder what is behind, to meander and imagine otherwise. Ahmed calls this "turning the tables"<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-aff4fa5293a87bbc" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-aff4fa5293a87bbc"><a data-footref="14" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-aff4fa5293a87bbc" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, where we situate a table by letting its background sink in and by caring for the work and maintenance that is often ''hidden from view"(Ibid, 63) to make room for these queer, crip, social and domestic tables to be generative discourses within research and knowledge creation. This is where tables become many, where they deviate from straight standardised and projected 'known' formulas and become complex assemblages, with histories, sedimentations and horizons.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The "bodily horizon"(Ibid, 55) is key to understanding Ahmed's figure, as it asks, what do we orient ourselves towards? What do we bring towards ourselves from our horizon, and what objects do we let slip from view and out of reach? When we acknowledge we have limits to our perception, that we cannot see the whole environment, image or figure, we must be in a context. Ahmed's horizon queers phenomenology's horizon and encourages us to consider our own orientation, situate ourselves within our bodily horizon of social and domestic relations and ask which orientations of space make our bodies feel out of place. With Nirmal Puwar's 'Space Invaders', Ahmed shows how non-white bodies in places oriented for white bodies makes them feel "out of place" (Ibid, 133). She says that these bodies are disoriented by the society and people around them: "people blink and then look again" (Ibid, 135).

In feeling out of place at, disoriented by and in retreat from institutional tables this research(er) asks what it means to move within reach of another way of dwelling at these tables of computation, collaboration and institution, and specifically one that cares for and affirms crip and queer lives, experiences and knowledges.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

In queering the axis and the paths I take, I can think through what it means to not always know the path, to get lost and connect things that aren't together when they are held in place by sedimented norms. For Ahmed, potential naivety around the proper way of doing things is a place of production where queer lines are drawn and other paths are made. This means that there is great strength in holding on to these institutional tables, however much they may try to throw you off, or move apart. By being there, and by making wiggle room<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-f30db7a3639f74c7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-f30db7a3639f74c7"><a data-footref="x11" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-f30db7a3639f74c7" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, wiggling tables together and apart, I create the room I need to move towards the queer lines and modes of orientation that I desire. This room to breathe offer me the capacity to touch, feel out and imagine what my needs are and what paths may make these possible. Where do I have to move to be in reach of these needs and desires? Through transdisciplinarity I have the agency to imagine and practice what combinations of lines, what muddling of methods and disassociation of discipline makes the room for the change I need now. Much like Ahmed's navigation of butch-femme dynamics, transdisciplinarity is not meant to de-legitimise disciplinary fields or sedimented relations, but is meant to approach them as performances of knowledge and practices. Orienting disciplines in this way means that I can start to make room for what was once "unlivable" in disciplines' inherited terms. Again, this approach in its disobedience doesn't outright discredit the disciplines it works with but asks how their performed orientations may cross and transpose one another, what that could put in reach, and how making disciplines touch in other ways reshapes the bodily horizons of the disciplines themselves. This moves the focus from boundaries to orientations and how I can trace situated queer paths between disciplinary lines for myself. In this research, I bring together and move across fields of queer feminism, crip theory, critical access, disability justice, STS, media studies, information studies, artistic/creative practice, and software studies, to ask how a crip network and collective organisational practices can be made live-able between the institutions of computing and academia that systematically invalidate disabled queer lives.</p></div><div></div><div>

She makes an analogy here with a lump on her finger from where she grips her pen, where her finger has built up and sedimented its form in relation to the pen. Ahmed sums it up simply as "what we ''do do'' affects what we ''can do.''" (Ibid, 59). She refuses the hegemonic causality of a focus on doing as a singular straight direction. Instead, she suggests orientation is an expanding of a certain direction, that may relationally restrict others, but is not determinative. Her definition makes it possible for orientations and their sedimentations to not be singular in focus, and to make room form them to be navigated and approached within complex relations on our horizons and to take queer paths between them. When this approach arrives at the regressive mono-logics of institutional efficiencies, it disobediently opens up the many other paths and directions that are contingent.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ahmed also discusses RSI as a potential effect of inheritance, sedimentation, time, repetition, and the determined table. RSI is the strain and pain caused from bodies repetitively conforming to a tables that does not care for them and figures them to be disabled before they begin. Here, bent over, hunched and aching as I work, in this cramped spot, is the perfect time to stretch out into Ahmed's queering of orientation. With RSI, I overtly feel how my body wants to be orientated<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-3ceae001a940e6e3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-3ceae001a940e6e3"><a data-footref="16" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-3ceae001a940e6e3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, but I am contorted by inflexible hard systems, infrastructures and relations, through an institutional table that can only orientate my towards an ideology of efficient work. Through a queer orientation, Ahmed prompts me to listen to my bodies, my aches and my axes, to feel what I tend towards or need to retreat from.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It is helpful to question these relations of RSI through Ahmed's concept of inheritance<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-3ceae001a940e6e3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-3ceae001a940e6e3"><a data-footref="17" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-3ceae001a940e6e3" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, thinking through not only where these projections of contorted bodies and relations have come from, but also what they perpetuate. What are the horizons of these inherited relations, and what is reachable from these positions? When the straight/atomic home is orientated so that there is a "requirement that we bring home the "other sex" ... ''same race"" (Ibid, 127), then it is orientated to be self-perpetuating, autopoetic, and demanding a "good likeness". This orientation of a home demands that everyone be "in line" and maintain the norms and order of things, making sure that the relations and hierarchies "line up" between generations. Ahmed gives an example of drawing on tracing paper, copying lines over, and the sophisticated apparatus that philosophers, researchers, designers and institutional tables maintain to keep lines straight by "holding" things in place. These institutional apparatuses often smooth over any lumps, bumps, pains and aches that could queer the line and make it deviate. With Ahmed's approach I am empowered in some ways when I am disoriented by these enforced, inherited and sedimented lines, as this disorientation is a generative position of sense making, and to re-orient towards other tables and practices to sediment new queer and crip lines of affinity.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div>

It gives some depth to why these tables have been impossible for me to approach as a crip, let alone get a grip on. This isn't because the physical institutional setup have barriers that stops me from accessing them, nor does my chronic health often debilitate me, and fortunately my care system somewhat validates my disability<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-9fc7b6aa4a87cf53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-9fc7b6aa4a87cf53"><a data-footref="x1" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-9fc7b6aa4a87cf53" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. Nor is it that I am incapable of doing "quality" research. It is because of the political/relations of these institutions that burn me (out) every time I am in touch with them. It is because when I come to these tables they cut away at my capacities.

These crip lines are deviating orientations of survival and of life affirmation. What does it mean to be able to lay with these very queer and crip paths? Where can we hold this crip stuff and make times that celebrate them as places of generative access in conversation, instead of invalidating, problematising and backgrounding them from the tables where they have always been present but "hidden from view"?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Through discussing these backgrounds this chapter acts as the positioning statement of the research. It aims to contextualise the research within queer and crip theory, specifically Sara Ahmed's work (2006) on Queer Phenomenology; Alison Kafer's work (2013; 2017; 2021; 2023) on crip time, her political/relational model of disability, and her crazed crip manifestings. I also orient this towards my focus of technoscience with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Manifesto (2019), Hamraie's wider work of access friction and access knowledge. This framework is used throughout the thesis to not only frame the analysis but also situate the work from my experiences of institutional relations to access, computing and care as a crip &amp; trans teacher, coder, collective instigator and researcher. Following Sara Ahmed I aim to offer an approach to how "bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable" (2006), specifically how this shaping takes place when approaching accessible futures for crip and disabled folks at the institutional tables of research, computing and collective practice. Building from Ahmed's figure and framework of the table as an "orientation device" this chapter asks what are these tables I am approaching, and why do I (often) retreat instead of taking a seat? It makes room to question what the normative and inherited political/relations of these institutional tables are, and how crip as method and situated experience, practice and knowledges makes room for us to imagine, coalesce, disorient and manifest other collective tables into being.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This framework held in parallel with the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> chapter, forms an orientation for this research that proposes crip manifestings, manifestos, protocols and infrastructures as a way to re-orient the norms of computational practices through a cripping disorientation. This disorientation asking us to refuse the pull, the heckles and obligations of tech practices and to listen to our own crip and queer axes, ones of life affirmation and radical relational politics, to form our own deviating lines that fit our collective and community bodily horizons instead of cutting away at them. This thesis draws other lines of survival, of necessity and of crip movement making, where we refuse orientations of tables and relations that aim to break bodies before they begin. Instead, it seeks to form practices to manifest together orientations and movements that can turn these tables towards stories of collective liberation and care.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div>

This refusal, not of these technologies, but of how their imaginaries are oriented, politicised and enacted, is key to my disobedient crip research into technology.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer's media analysis of cyborgs shows that they are again sedimented without question to be a cure for impairment, to make 'normal' disabled bodies. These narratives, as raised by Kafer's analyses of Chris Hables Gray's <em>Cyborg Citizen</em>, lead to Gray, an able-bodied science studies scholar, taking up the late <em>Superman</em> actor Christopher Reeve, without his knowledge or consent, as a heroic cyborg leading the way for the disabled community. Gray suggests that the "crippling of superman" and Reeve becoming dependent on multiple machines and devices is one of the best examples of a "true" cyborg. Gray states that Reeve is a hero as he leads the way for other disabled bodies to be cured through assistive technologies. Gray's text in a number of ways undermines the disabled experience, as it doesn't make room for Reeve or people with disabilities, and more specifically quadriplegic people, to speak to their use of and relation to access and assisted living technologies. Kafer also points out that Gray overlooks and cannot imagine that there is a wider disabled community than just the celebrity in focus, Reeve, or that these communities have a long history and culture of living with assistive technologies that might be informative. Kafer also shares how his use of language often refers to people with disabilities as "invalids" or "patients", conflating their whole identity and personhood with an injury or the medical identification of their condition. Sitting here, Kafer figures Gray as a prime example of how the disabled bodies are oriented when deployed in cyborg theory. In one of many other examples, Annie Potts' "taxonomy of cyborgs" places Reeves in a list with fictional cyborgs, orienting him as less human and more cyborg, a construction rather than a complex, multifaceted person. In these cyborg curing narratives, Kafer shows how this signalling of disabled people as the truest cyborgs locks in and has sedimented the path so much that a cyborg itself becomes a signal for disability, abnormality and difference. The cyborg~crip, the crip~cyborg.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">By contrast, Kafer reads Haraway's figure of a "cyborg" in the <em>Cyborg Manifesto</em> (2006) as problematic in some aspects, but an empowering plurality to think through when approaching with feminist STS. The problematic notions of the Harraway's cyborg are somewhat well known; for example, its homogenising of experiences ny taking an imperializing approach that dictates one figure of an identity for whole groups of people (Kafer 2013, 114). Kafer, however, offers a closer crip critique of Haraway's cyborg, tracing how she has also fallen into the sedimented route that portrays disabled bodies, or as she determines them "paraplegics and other severely handicapped people", to be exemplary or true cyborgs. In this move, Haraway makes a number of questionable choices. She addresses these imagined people with disabilities in terms of "handicap" and describes them as "paraplegic", which reinforces the individualism and diagnosis of the medical model. Kafer also points out this critique of naming languages was fairly common discourse within that era of disability studies, of which Haraway was likely aware. Haraway also homogenizes experiences of disabled people like she does for other identities, but in doing so displaces the affective relations to technologies these different disabled positions and experiences make room for. She essentially does not include any affective perspectives on what it feels like to be a person who is disabled and (inter)dependent with/on technologies and infrastructures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Even though Haraway's "cyborg" is in many ways flawed, especially in relation to intersectional disability, Kafer still finds it to be generative from a crip position. In particular, the cyborg can also figure the defiant feminist care in and against flawed and often violent technoscience. The cyborg finds joy in acts of practising radical care otherwise. Kafer disorient the cyborg as a fluid figure that can make room for us to figure out other paths between people with disabilities and the technologies that support them. She refigures the cyborg as a place of embodied crip futures, on their/our terms, validating and tracing a plurality of paths we take with technology together. It is this focus on how the cyborg makes room for crip studies to cross paths with other disciplines and experiences that is what makes this a generative space for her. Kafer gives examples of different cyborg intersections within disability studies, such as Dean Spade's research into the medicalisation of transgender identities. Spade navigates trans experiences of gender identity disorder (GID), which is used to validate care and medication, but also acts to reinforce the binary of gender as well as prolong and delay care (Kafer 2013, 124). GID also leads to tensions, with potentially ableist undertones and a medicalisation of queer identities, where needing to self-identify and be validated as having a "condition" or disorder to be treated as trans could lead to gender identity being read as an individual handicap instead of political and relational issue. Spade also reads this medicalisation of GID as reproducing the "curing" narrative, where specific treatments can resolve the individual "problem" of gender identity, and can be industrialised. Kafer works with Spade and others here to trouble these notions by stating "that neither medical technologies nor diagnoses can be characterized as purely oppressive or politically neutral" (Ibid, 125). This disorientation feels the individual within the relational, situated, and makes room for the cyborg and their bodily horizons to be read as "maps of power and identity". In doing this, the cyborg also makes space for "affinity-through-difference"<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-29161bb956b68a44"><a data-footref="r21" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, where disabled people as a very diverse community can come together and lay with the disorientation of these many contradictory bodily maps and horizons. With this Kafer figures crips to be cyborgs not because of their bodily relations and dependence on assistive technology and technical infrastructure, that have been naturalised to signal disability, but because of the political practices we disobediently undertake. These acts of refusal are the tracings of our own queer and crip lines, the feeling and coalescing of other crip techno bodies, tables and relations. Some examples of this kind of rubbing up against and disobeying technology, whilst living through it, is shared in Laura Forlano's many works critiquing the cyborg as a concept. In both her <em>Hacking the Feminist Disabled Body</em> (2016) and <em>Living Intimately with Machines</em> (2023) she foregrounds the disabled experience of technology and relation to it as a place of generative friction. If oriented this way it can make room for other perspectives, methods and ethics to be present and felt at these tables. Kafer concludes her analysis by vulnerably opening up the idea that the cyborg within this plurality is also not the only figure for disability, as some disabled experiences may relate more and some less to these technological entanglements. However, she does encourage attending to these sites where disability is pressent within discourse but not felt or made room for. Much like Kafer's intervention into Haraway's cyborg, I also take this approach later in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md" href="../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> with Lucy Suchmans <em>Configuration</em> (2012) to critique the ways disabled bodies can disorient the horizons and practices I take toward collective organisation and network infrastructures. </p></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Crip (Technoscience) Manifesto" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Crip_(Technoscience)_Manifesto"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Crip (Technoscience) Manifesto</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer follows up on <em>Feminist, Queer and Crip</em> (2013) with a talk called <em>Health Rebels: A Crip Manifesto for Social Justice</em> (2017) as well as <em>Manifesting Manifestos</em> (2023). In the Health Rebels talk she covers many of the bases of her work that I have covered elsewhere, but through other informative anecdotes, experiences and relations through which to imagine this work. The focus in this talk is coalition, of cross-issue collaboration and working within difference together. In the talk Kafer appears to refigure her crip cyborg into a number of other figures, such as "health rebels", "the checklist", and "the manifesto". Health rebels play out somewhat similarly to the cyborg, as the defiant crips in the face of the medical industrial complex and institutional ableism. In coalition, living crip as method, multiple and indeterminate, forming frictions at our many horizons and  intersection with these generalised and prescribed norms. Disobediently disoriented, aligning to the crip axes. The checklist represents the rubric, matrix or limited drop-down selection that indeterminate disabled bodies are (in)validated through. I discuss my experiences of this further in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02_The_computing_table</a> section, where efficient logics determine static lines that are used to invalidate needs, experiences, practises and knowledges. Building on her earlier troubling of the crip cyborg as the only figure to live by, Kafer loosens and refigures the manifesto to be a place of wiggle room, of playing out our dreams, testing out futures, of finding gaps and frictions in these manifestings as generative places to write other crip manifestos and imagine other futures from action. To do this she turns to queer theory, as we could easily to Ahmed, to reflect on how a manifesto (or an orientation) moves along a horizon, foreclosing and limiting some relations whilst putting some others in reach. For Kafer, quoting Audre Lorde, the manifesto is "believing, working for what has not yet been while living fully in the present now."<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-29161bb956b68a44"><a data-footref="r22" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup> Here it acts as a place to live with uncertainty and practise actioning and inquiring into crip methods for indeterminate futures. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer later follows this talk up with her essay <em>Manifesting Manifestos</em> (2023) where she takes an even closer reading of this writing format. In this essay she traces their problematic past within patriarchal modernist thought that unifies bodies, but also the sedimented critique of feminist manifestos that call the mad and crazed. In this Kafer disobediently steps into this critque to question how the manifesto makes room for this crips to be mad with and through their madness. With Breanne Fahs, Kafer also proposes this crazed manifesto as a format that "invites disorientation" (2020, 5) as it makes room for a distortion of time and a projection of bodies into other futures not yet in reach, but desired now. She also offers with Kafer (2016) how manifestos are a place to iterate from, adapt, change and find holes in our plans and manifestings. Here again not invalidating, hidding or trying to cure these flaws but, as she reflects on with her students manifesto, it is about making change through embracing and being oriented through these many situated flaws on the plurality of bodily horizons I come into contact with. In this research I ask alongside Kafer how, through a plurality of manifestos, can crip studies and disability justice can take on struggles we may have never imagined before? And how can we try to make room for people and relations that have not yet been imagined or thought of at these sedimented institutional tables yet?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this research, I iterate on from (but still with) Kafer's plurality of crazed manifestos to work more closely with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's <em>Crip Technoscience Manifesto</em> (2019). This is to orient my research more closely towards critiques of technoscience, but also to highlight crip manifesting and manifestos in practice. Their manifesto reiterates Kafer's work in a similar way to what I have discussed here, but situates it through more specifically STS relevant examples and positions. Key examples that are relevant to this work include ADAPT activist forming and shaping physical infrastructures by pouring ramps and smashing curbs, as well as Alice Wong's <em>Disability Visibility Project</em> forming social and media representation by and for disabled people. Both examples, and many other crip sociotechnical hackings they touch on, manifest forms of direct action, of making change and caring for community infrastructures where institutions invalidate the political/relational forms through which they perpetuate ableism. Hamraie and Fritsch orient the <em>Crip Technoscience Manifesto</em> itself through commitments, manifesting a crip technoscience specifically through direct actions, embodied protocols and political demands. They do this to not only make this manifesto clear and accessible, but also to project into the future the embodied actions and relations that could make room for crip discourses and politics in practices to flourish in relation to technoscience.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I discuss these commitments below to highlight key orientations this work is building from.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Crip technoscience centres the work of disabled people as knowers and makers."</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This positions the everyday practices and experiences of disabled people as that which orients them to best know their bodyminds and relations to technologies and society. They work with a few examples of crip designers to show how this plays out in action. Alice Loomer, for instance, shows us how wheelchair maintenance and hacking by the person using it, even though not a frictionless experience, forms practices and knowledges of technology that are situated in relation to that body and its horizon. They quote Loomer saying, "I have equipment that fits me", offering how disabled knowing/making through embodied expertise of technologies can make room for these bodies within technoscience. This is not to glorify the Do-It-Yourself practices of disabled people, as some may not be able (or want) to do "it", but it is to uplift the "world-dismantling and world-building labors" that "misfitting" in the world as a crip means and to orient from that disorientation.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Crip technoscience is committed to access as friction."</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Friction for Hamraie and Fritsch represents the refusal to fit in of crip technoscience, of wanting more than the slots you are offered in the determined checklist, and taking actions and making frictions to make that room. They lay with the "non-compliant user", from Ray Lifchez and Barbara Winslow's book <em>Design for Independent Living</em> (1979), who use technology as a friction against an inaccessible environment to highlight the change needed<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-29161bb956b68a44"><a data-footref="r23" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-29161bb956b68a44" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>. They also discuss Collin Kennedy, an activist and cancer patient, who refused capitalist time around care by spraying expanding foam into hospital car park meters. In doing so, Kennedy disabled the capacity of these infrastructures to monitor and charge patients visiting the hospital, and so forming new possibilities and imaginaries of crip time through direct action forming friction on the sedimented norms. When thinking of frictions, I also want to return to the section on <a class="internal-link" data-href="02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> with Ashley-X, and think again about the possibility of curtailed joys and pleasures that can come from the frictions of our disabled lives. With crip technoscience this also aims to ask how direct actions, material transformations, practice of maintenance, the rubbing up against restrictions, and the frictions felt from these actions can make room for joy, pleasure and abundance. How could Kennedy wiggling the nose of the expanding foam can into the ticket machine to make room for crip time in a car park, bring joy to not only him, but also to others who were visiting that day. Those who now did not need to rush, or keep in-line and on time? These friction-enabling experiences of crips slips beyond institutional and capitalist time and offers glimpses of a future we can wiggle into with and for one another. With "access as friction" we can embrace the struggles of making change where we need it, of getting in the way, and disorienting conversations and in doing so reconfiguring the infrastructures and institutions around us, possibly even with unknowable joy and pleasure.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Crip technoscience is committed to interdependence as political technology."</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the scoping of both feminist technoscience and the political/relational model of disability, how we work together around/for/with technology is itself a type of technology and method that we must orient around and practice. In crip technoscience and wider crip studies, there is a dedication to practising this through interdependence, focusing on how our capacities build up to together, and how we can make room for each other. What politics come from these places, what emerges from the ground up and can radically change the ways we imagine, embody and practice potential future politics now? One example Hamraie and Fritsch quote which resonates with this work is that of Mia Mingus's "access intimacy" (2017), which is hard to describe but easily felt. Access intimacy attends to how much someone 'gets' another's access needs, how they make room for them to express these feelings, even if it's stating you don't know what they are right now. Access intimacy as a concept makes room for me to imagine intimate ways of relating to others and how we can care for one another's access needs. It is to be open to the unknown and practice getting to know other's access needs.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Crip technoscience is committed to disability justice."</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Manifesting crip technoscience that engages in disability rights goes beyond the assimilationist ideologies of mainstream accessibility to highlight how interconnected struggles, and finding justice in them, can make room for even more radical practices for crips within sociotechnical systems. When working for disability justice, crips refuse painful assistive technologies which only normalise their bodies to make others more comfortable. Disability justice also aligns this work with many intersections of disability studies to form a crip technoscience that is informed by and practices with working class, black, brown and indigenous disabled knowledges. It is one where we vouch for crip wholeness and life affirmation as places we can radically challenge the economics and politics of ableist powers that see us as broken or invalid. For this holding the impossible they turn to Eli Clare (2017), whose work suggests we can be broken and yet whole, imperfect, but valued, and holding a generative tension between the (not) opposites of these things.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Hamraie and Fritsch also engage with the work of Sins Invalid and other crip artists and hackers to think through what Alice Sheppard (2019) calls "cultural-aesthetic technoscience". This is where they bring together new assemblages and aesthetics for communicating these complex relations of wholeness. Sins Invalid, for example, combine performance, technological aids and films doused in unashamed crip joy and pride, not hiding, but embracing and putting on show the potentials for love, grief and playfulness in a very serious but joyous space. As these thinkers and artists share, joy and pleasure are not the only way to achieve or approach disability justice as they can undermine the complex relations of disability globally, which work through oppression and debilitation as politics. Instead, engaging in and making room for this contradictory wholeness of disability justice is what shapes a crip technoscience that coalesces and dances with these sedimented tables through resistance. It is where I can build from the non-innocent, from the disabling continuation/aftermath of war, Big Tech extraction, petrochemical and medical industrial complex, to work with these embodied and plural crip experiences, knowledges and practices to form other ways of caring for each other, our technologies and our communities.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Crip manifestos are multiple in the ways that we can understand them coming together through action.

These crip forms of manifesting, of making principles and agreements, of forming and imagining infrastructures and room we need now, and of telling stories of futures and relations with us in and yet to unfold, are what this research orients from. It inquires through how In my collaborations we can collectively imagine and action these other sets of politics, protocols and ways of relating from the sites of impact and friction. It is to make room for us to feel out from our embodied disorientations and towards community led technology. In this movement I have taken up disobedient action research as my methodology, as the next chapter highlights. In this work, my research is performed across scales, from internally inner arcs of embodied change and practice to movement that aim to go beyond by becoming intimate with these institutional limits and norms.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

Ahmed is in many ways an amazing commentator on disability and anti-ableism, but here I turn to Alison Kafer's table, and to her work with her <em>Feminist, Queer, Crip</em>. Kafer's formation of the Political/Relational model of disability, and discussion on Crip Time as a concept makes room for me to question through more focused crip lens how "bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable" (Ahmed, 2006). In doing so I am thinking through how politics and relations form and hold disability in place, and in turn how through community, interdependence and collective access in action can make room for disability's indeterminacy to manifest many other futures together. I also inquire into Kafer's figuring of crip time not only as a way to hold many indeterminate bodies, but also as a way to understand and navigate the scoping of actions taken in this research. I reflect on the many scales that collaborative labours take, especially around manifesting collective infrastructures, from the infinite small meetings and feelings that I could never capture, to scales of maintenance that could have ended yesterday, or could stretch beyond my lifetime. With this, I also slip onto Kafer's table the <em>Crip Technoscience Manifesto</em> (2019) by Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch, to re-orient these dialogues towards social and technical infrastructures and science technology studies (STS). Here I orient the crip as a social and technical hacker, reforming and manifesting infrastructures through direct action, affective feedback and refusal that centre crip knowledge and experience within making and doing. With this I ask what does it take for crips to make and sit cozily at tables of disability justice, access and life affirmation within and around institutions and infrastructures of research, computation and care? I want to approach these questions with others, within our capacity, with passion, pleasure and joy, asking: where/how can we make room to imagine and practise other political relations of liberation and affirmation, now?!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">02.02.00_The_Crip_Table</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 9; transform: translate(-920px, 2080px); width: 760px; height: 528px; --canvas-node-width: 760px; --canvas-node-height: 528px; --canvas-color: 65,103,60;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Crip Time + Crip Futures" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Crip_Time_+_Crip_Futures"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Crip Time + Crip Futures</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Can we tell crip tales, crip time tales, with multiple befores and afters, proliferating befores and afters, all making more crip presents possible?" (Kafer 2021, 418)</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of the focuses of Kafer's <em>Feminist, Queer, Crip</em> and her wider research is her figuring out of crip time. Crip time is manifested by many different people in crip theory, from Ellen Samuel's <em>Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time</em> (2017), to Margaret Price's <em>Mad at School</em> (2011, p.&nbsp;62) which offers generative affective definitions, to Kafer's <em>After Crip, Crip Afters</em> (2021) and David P. Terry's <em>Explanation not Excuse</em> (2016) that poetically describe crip times. <em>Prioritizing Crip Futures</em> (Abrams et al., 2024) and Sins Invalid's <em>Crip Kinship</em> of Sins Invalid (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;75) also offer crip time in action in institutional and crip collective contexts. Crip time here makes room for a paradoxical and non-linear temporality that aims to sit with disabled people's bodies and experiences on their terms instead of enforcing a normative able-bodied orientation of time<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-39551aa6c5f1b887"><a data-footref="x12" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. In essence, crip time is the refusal of determinate, straight, evenly-paced timelines. I choose to build from Kafer's definitions because of her emphasis on the systemic and political relations of temporalities that freeze and hold crips and disabled folks in place, as well as the ways we can hack and form wiggle room within these dominant hegemonic times. Kafer builds up her definition through a few moves but starts by cripping Lee Edelman's queer time against the future (Kafer 2013, 28). Here she takes up the figure of the 'Child' as a symbol of the future that in queer theory is often also a symbol of the deterministic straight line of inheritance towards able straight futures<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-39551aa6c5f1b887"><a data-footref="x13" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>. The figure of the Child is also heavily bound to the histories of eugenics, which conflated disabled, racialised, poor and indigenous bodies into the categories "feeble-minded" or "defective", and used to justify forced sterilisation or euthanasia for the future of the "race" (Ibid, 30). The legacies of these eugenic logics persist in contemporary prenatal selection and abortion of disabled children to "solve" the problem before it starts, and which the UK has re-enitiated this year (Maia Davies 2025). This emphasis on the future reinforces the endless deferral of care for disabled folks, that instead of making room and capacity to care for them now, orients funding to cure society and futures of their disabled bodies. One example Kafer takes up is of Noam Ostrander's interviews with young black men in Chicago with violently acquired spinal cord injuries (Ibid, 33). She highlights this case as it not only shows how the violent relations through which these men became disabled are so sedimented that their disabling was treated as inevitable, but also that becoming disabled was a foreclosure on their life, and one that determined them to have no future. Here she is sharing how disability is imagined by ableism to have no future, and that to authoritarian eugenics logics, reinforced through race, class, sexuality, gender identity and more, determine disability as a category to forcibly place bodies that they do not want to see in the future.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In her book Kafer engages with the figure of the "Child" to disorient dialogues around disabled bodies that do not seem to fit in hegemonic futures. She does this by inquiring into both disabled peoples abilities to procreate more disabled bodies (children), as well as exploring the capacities disabled people have to procreate culture, social relations and intimacies. By doing so, she questions the hegemonic terms through which disability's futures are represented. She elaborates on this by studying both mainstream media narratives playing out these political imaginaries and contemporary social and technical infrastructures that reinforce these ableist politics systemically.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For example, Kafer reads Marge Piercy's <em>Woman on the Edge of Time</em>, and its legacy within feminist studies as a text that demonstrates "inclusivity" and political democracy within science (Ibid, 72). Through a crip lens, Kafer's analysis shows it is anything but inclusive or democratic. This Utopian world has in fact eradicated all disabled people without any mention or dialogue that included them. The fictive society is in many ways Utopian because it has eradicated disabled people through genetic science and technological advancement. The fictive infrastructure that has enabled this is called the brooder, which mixes and selects genes to form neutral healthy children of all races, but in doing so eradicates disabled bodies without question. In the same move it also blends and displaces race as a way to cure us of cultural difference and racial inequality. When held in comparison to the depicted Dystopia, which is filled with disabled and mad bodyminds, it shares how disabled people's existence here represents one of the main signifies of this utopian/dystopian split. Beyond the macro of this split, the only mention of disability in the utopia is of people taking mental health breaks, where they drop out from society. This in many ways still enacts the erasure of disability from society, put to one side, siloed and hidden from sight until normal or cured. Through Kafer's analysis she shows how neither the utopian nor dystopian futures make room for or imagine disabled people to live full lives, or affirm their experiences. In these futures disabled people are either the abundant problem or are silently cured from existence as part of the solution. In these narratives, disabled bodies, feelings and experiences are not included in the making of futures. In utopia, they have been invalidated and backgrounded at every step towards this "greater good".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In response I have shared how Kafer constructs a crip time that makes room to hold the affective, embodied and experiential relations to time that disabled bodies have the capacity to feel. This affective crip relation to time emerges through disabling relations to institutions, systems and infrastructures, or just how disabled bodyminds queerly move through and experience time and space<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-39551aa6c5f1b887"><a data-footref="x14" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>. Kafer presents many forms of crip time, from the slowing down and indefinite postponing of care, to the immediacy of when we need to care right now. Crip time takes the form of cycles of time that complicate the normative straight cycles of the able-bodied clock, and disables people from accessing in-flexible institutions, financial stability and self-determinacy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer aligns crip time with Jack Halberstam's discussion of queer time, in particular the "strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices" of queer life (Ibid, 35). For Halberstam,the immediacy of the AIDS crisis, specifically for gay men and their communities took them out of mainstream and normative time, to a time of "the here, the present, the now" (Ibid, 35). In crip contexts, Kafer describes a "falling time". Falling ill or getting a prognosis changes perceptions of time, shrinks futures and intensifies the present. When falling into depression, time is slowed to a stop, yet can fly by. How does time feel when there are uncertainties as to whether a chemical, food or unpredictable trigger could induce symptoms that will take you out of time? These fallings into "strange temporalities" leaves space for disabled people to feel these times as they are and not line-up to a straight and normative time, validating and enabling crip bodies to tell stories that can change how we think with time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">For "imaginative life schedules" Kafer brings to the forefront the ways that disabled people have to pre-plan and hack systems of care to be in reach of their needs. How partners and friends need to split carers and medicines, as systems have valued one over the other. How families and friends need to fill the gaps. How bathroom visits have to be pre-planned and scheduled. Kafer poses these "imaginative life schedules" not just as the extenuated day to day planning that most disabled people take on, but as the need to project crip bodies into the future to maintain them. This maintenance is highlighted not just as (re)production that we see within efficiency models, but as pleasurable acts of each day, and towards unknown practices of radical access. These schedules then become a place with a possibility of joy for organising and maintaining embodied futures for disabled lives that resist the violence of institutional and hegemonic determination of disabled futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With "eccentric economic practices" Kafer talks about the ways that crip people are economic hackers. When the lines of systemic and institutional care don't hold you and you start to slip through. When they limit how much you can earn to maintain your care subsidies and determine you into a certain level of (dis)comfort. This is when these eccentric economics are necessitated and practised, to trade goods, favours and pleasures under the radar so that crips don't compromise our basic needs and care. These economics for Kafer this offers a blurring of the public/private in a way that makes room for these economics to be a test bed for us to imagine what crip politics in action might be capable of. This is where our everyday practices of collective access and interdependence become radical methods for rethinking the politics of how we come together and table, or put to bed our differences.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer's situates crip time between a time of falling in the here and now, meanwhile maintaining our bodies to enact a future with us in it by practising politics of our everyday. Kafer goes on to examine how this framing of crip time lines up against narratives of longevity, focusing on cripping Halberstam's notion of keeping going "under any circumstances"<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-39551aa6c5f1b887"><a data-footref="x15" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-4-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a></sup>. In a queer refusal of longevity, hegemony is understood to reproduce deterministic futures indefinitely. A crip position instead sits with each situated body differently. Kafer asks what it means for that or this body to keep going "under any circumstance"<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-5-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-5-39551aa6c5f1b887"><a data-footref="x16" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-5-39551aa6c5f1b887" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[5]</a></sup>, and how can we ease the institutional and social pressures that curtail crip life at every turn. Here she is moving to also step out of line and inquire, "what are the circumstances we need but also desire?", and by asking this, also asking how to orient them to be within reach.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To make time for crip time, where we feel our crip bodies maintained in a future that holds them is to radically reconfigure our relations to almost every part of our lives under efficient time. To embody a future with us in it is to practice access as affirmation and to make room and time for people to consent, to be present in and the capacity to care for that time. A future embodied by crips would aim to foster time from a another radical set of roots that can overlay, intertwine and embrace a plurality of times. This radical embrace of crip time makes room within relations, futures and immediate actions that make time for us to hold this crip stuff with care "under any circumstances".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To tie down and bring in-line the proliferating befores and afters of these indeterminate crip time tales, as I have had to for this thesis, I have thought about how to find orientation within space and time that shifts, trickles and lets loose without reason. To sit in disorientation is to be crip, and to be crip is to be more than aslant from the straight axis of time. But with a crip disorientation as an axis, one that changes with bodies in relation, and holds more or less than the x,y,z of things, I start to trace the paths of my crip time tales to future horizons abundant with crips.

With this approach, the research makes room for my collaborators and I to be in touch with these network infrastructures. Doing this we focused on where we felt slips, slants, gaps and frictions to orient our approaches to the normative logics within computing. This was to question how these points of impact give us an ambivalent relation for us to imagine and practise crip futures from now. In coalescing Ahmed, Kafer, Hamraie and Fritsch, as well as many others, together in a crooked crip line for this chapter, I have formed a framework that aims to overflow from these sites of friction. This is to not avoid or invalidate these disconnects and misfittings, but to think through how they can inform other orientations from a position of radical Crip intersectionality, interdependence and disability justice. Working from these crip slants, naps and f(r)ictions are places that can build up our collective capacities for us to move off from the sedimented straight line of inheritance, break open the normative pipeline, and its determined relations, and make room for this research to question how my collaborators and I want to approach relational "problems" we are seated at together ourselves.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To disorient these tables and relational norms I later turn to the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.04_The_crip_table</a> as an axis of radical access, interdependence and coalition where I informed my practise and research.

This methodology and its iterating plurality of manifestings will unfold more throughout the thesis, but moves to put more digital network practice within reach of crip theory discourse. This is to think about how we can foster and centre crip practices and politics of radical care within our local community and collective configuration practices, but also to think about how these politics can overflow and make room and flexibility in these hard systems for other lines to be emegred elsewhere by others also facing their own frictions with efficient, white supremacist and curative politics. This approach aims to form collective politics that do not determine or prescribe methods and approaches, but makes room to contemplate how I as a collective technical practitioner can become intimate with collaborators access needs. Here making wiggle room for us all to be experts, practitioners and knowers/makers of our own (life affirming) infrastructures, and in doing so gaining agency and capacities at the tables we have always been present at, but were never allowed to get to grips with.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">02.03.00_Conclusion</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 11; transform: translate(120px, 2608px); width: 751px; height: 400px; --canvas-node-width: 751px; --canvas-node-height: 400px; --canvas-color: 65,103,60;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h3 heading-wrapper"><h3 data-heading="Crip intersectionality &amp; Coalition" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Crip_intersectionality_&amp;_Coalition"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Crip intersectionality &amp; Coalition</h3><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Crip relation to intersectionality is one of the most radical approaches to the term, as it is so abundant and overflowing. This is due to the variety of bodies, experiences and struggles that exist under the broad terms of disability. Of course we can turn to Kimberly Crenshaw's definition of intersectionality(Crenshaw 1991; 2015), and it's emergence from groups like the Combahee River Collective, where "interlocking oppressions" form at the cross roads of identities. This in many ways comes from and speaks to disability (even if it is not overtly stated), but I find it more interesting to look at definitions that come from the overt practices of crip studies. This Crip kinship (2021) as Shayda Kafai would term it, is where the abundance of crip communities and interdependence of intersections shine. Kafai's book centres on the practices of Sins Invalid, a crip performance group started by Patty Berne and Leroy Moore. Sins Invalid's work centres expressing crip pleasures, joy and desire without shame and through interdependence. The group's definition of intersectionality is one that I hold dear in my research and repeatedly reflect on in my practice.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>"Sins Invalid defines intersectionality this way: "Simply put, this principle says that we are many things, and they all impact us. We are not only disabled, we are also each coming from a specific experience of race, class, sexuality, age, religious background, geographic location, immigration status, and more. Depending on context, we all have areas where we experience privilege, as well as areas of oppression... We gratefully embrace the nuance that this principle brings to our lived experiences, and the ways it shapes the perspectives we offer."" (Ibid, 31)</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This definition of intersectionality by Sins Invalid has helped me to think through how I can come together with collaborators to practice crip freedoms together. To treat these intersections with care and situate our capacities, privileges and desires into and out of alignment. Kafer also notes Robert McRuer's notion of "the non-disabled claim to be crip" (2013, p.&nbsp;169), which I follow: the possibility of able bodied crips, of those working for the disabled cause, but also maybe those that recognise the "the disability to come." Committing to this wider scope of intersectional disability justice is a key step for any crip studies critique, as accessibly explained in Ella Parry-Davies' <em>Coming out Crip</em> (2022) audio piece. She, much like myself, is only "stable" because we live in the UK with a state health system that recognises our needs, and can "treat" them in its medical scoping of our conditions. If we were to live elsewhere, have different nationalities and the relational support those bodies have, we might not even be here, or able to make these statements. With this we embed ourselves within the mutual cause against all intersecting injustices towards disability.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this dialogue privilege and oppression are situated and negotiated both with intimacy. With this I have asked how can I as a white crip researcher, within academic institutions that are often inaccessible to other intersections of disabled people, use my privilege and oppression in this experience and context to leverage resources and change discourses to position disability justice and radical access as the next action I take at every turn? It also asks me to know that I will never know the experiences of other people with disability and to have patience and commitment, to get in touch with and to learn to communicate our collective sense making. It is to take our sweet crip ass time to get a feel for one another, and affirm each other along that path and journey.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I find it important to think through intersectionality with Kafer's reading of Ashley-X's story. This is because it offers clearly the ways we have to defy the urge to divide disability through its diversity, but to instead centre and care for these bodies on the margins of our discourse. Ashley is born with "static encephalopathy", that leads her doctors to state that "her development never progressed beyond that of an infant", and means that she depends on constant care for her lifetime. The nickname by carers for the condition and similar disabilities is a "pillow angel". Another element of this relation is that her body developed at a "normal" pace, and at age 6 her parents started to be concerned about what puberty would do to her. From consultations with medical "experts" they set up a plan to remove Ashley's uterus and breast buds, as well as put here on a high dose oestrogen regime. The medical "experts" in dialogue with the parents validated this treatment for many reasons, from "saving" Ashley from pains of menopause and puberty, as well as keeping her small so her parents could care and protect her directly, as well as keeping her safe from her own mature body. This meant that the way Ashley and her body were unconsensually treated was to be shaped for the able bodied world around them. They just made her easy to handle as well as protected from relations held in place by ableist and violent sexist politics. I work with Kafer's reading of Ashley for a few reasons, partially as it highlights the ways disabled bodies and experiences are curtailed to fit the hard ableist systems, scales and needs, instead of considering the disabled bodymind's own needs, orientations and desires. It also shares the length that these sorts of ableist actions can be taken to, how far an individual who cannot oppose can be shaped to fit the efficient line, instead of questioning the political relations of the line itself. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is highlighted by some mixed views from both medicine and disability studies, whether a person like Ashley-X is too disabled to be disabled, and whether people like them need their own category (Kafer 2013, 67). This division provokes yet another boundary beyond the able/disabled projected axis, forming again new complex parameters that permit questionably dehumanising and violent treatments, such as the one Ashley-X recieved. Kafer asks here what if we place people like Ashley-X not outside of disability discourse, but in the centre of it? When I start to imagine relations and tables to care for these experiences and not determine and invalidate their communication ability, I open myself up to feel and be felt through many yet unknowable ways. Kafer's enactment of crip theory here also centres the joy of this communication. In Ashley-X's case, a double mastectomy and hormone blockers to stop her breasts growing means that Ashley was also disabled from having any pleasure from these removed organs. Their pleasure was never imagined, nor valued in their future, only pain. That just because these experts were did not have the capacity to feel Ashley's expressions of joy, imagine their bodily possibilities of pleasure and agency, or even contemplate their political desires meant that it was these experts who had invalidated Ashley without question or dialogue. Instead of joy or pleasure, the dialogues around Ashley's body focus on pain or discomfort and keeping her secure from strangers, who may also feel this discomfort around her. Reflecting on Ashley-X through crip intersectionality, it can also be understood that this probably only happened to her as she came from a middle class American family that could afford to treat her through these medical industrial institutions. When I highlight her context, I think to how I can build up capacities to be in dialogue with each other. This is also amplified by disability as such a diverse field that includes so many bodyminds in so many different situated social/political relations. Again a crip move is to centre joy and pleasure as an actionable site for us to move from, but this is not to say we silence or ignore the very real pain that exists everyday within our community internationally and intersectionally. It instead aims to move beyond deterministic narratives of disability as painful and awkward and asking what brings us together through joy, comfort and pleasure, even if we are dealing with pain, depression and disabling social relations. Through feeling out these restraints we can start to move towards interdependently asking/demanding how to put our desires in reach of one another?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In Kafer's final chapter, 'Accessible Futures, Future Coalitions', she gives an example of Silvia Yee's work with the Disability rights education and Defense Fund (DreDF) (2013, p.&nbsp;160). Kafer highlights their work with communities facing the overburden of toxic industries and emissions to show how policy and access put in place to help disabled people in many ways benefits everyone. In the case of DreDF the rights of children with respiratory issues can stop schools and institutions from using potentially harmful chemical pesticides, which can benefit not only the quality of life of everyone in that district but also reduces the ecological impacts. This presents Crip intersectionality as a powerful place where in coalition we can leverage our communities access privileges to not only improve their individual lives but to put a future we all want into reach.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is where the interdependence of crips also sits as an essential practice. When disabled people struggle to perform as required by a system or to be valued the same as able-bodied people, communities have to help each other manage the gaps. Like I shared in Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures with Kafer's take on Halberstam's "strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices", all of these crip times are threaded through community schedules, care and interdependence. These acts can range from just consolidating to each other that it is fine that we are sad and mad, that there are gaps in what we are able to do, and being there when we almost fall through them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the third episode of the Crip Club podcast<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-72e870f48e624a77"><a data-footref="x18" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup> , which discusses disabled representation in films and media, Clare Baines interviews Jessi Gutch around cancer portrayals (Baines, o.&nbsp;J.). In the podcast they not only talk around what it means for Gutch to not fit into the curative narrative of cancer, but she also shares her experiences of living with a disability whilst working in the film industry. The section I felt was most informative for understandings of intersectionality and interdependence of disabled folk, is when she is talking about working in a majority disabled set. This crip background informed a very different set of expectations and capacities for one another. Gutch says that this formed a space where people could express their needs easily and have them affirmed, where everyone on set knew that this film was important, but not the most important thing. The most important thing is that everyone in this collaboration was feeling as good as they could in their bodyminds and able to do what they wanted to within the collaboration. It was where if they needed more time for this crip stuff they could have it without question.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In my practice as I have started to collaborate with more disabled and crip people I have also felt this same energy, where our wellbeing, capacities and feelings are prioritised over an imagined deterministic outcome or performance of work. I talk more about this in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.04_The_crip_table</a> section, but to touch on one of these collaborations that is of note here was in the creation of the crip infrastructure en-crip-ing time<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-72e870f48e624a77"><a data-footref="x19" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, a work that imagines and instigates crip times within computational time. I go on to discuss this work in context and in more detail in a later inquiry discussed in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md" href="../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time</a>. Here though one major part of the work was to focus on this type of crip relating between my collaborator Mariana Marangoni and I in the making of the infrastructure. This meant that there were no agile time-lines, roles or outcomes here, just crip times, flexibility and compassion. We both had many demands from life, and very crip times in relation to our bodyminds, but we both understood that for this intersection and crip infrastructure to emerge we both needed these times to prioritise our needs. When one of us had to freeze time to recover or get through something it was okay, we just said, and adjusted the timeline or responsibilities. When one got stressed and anxious about the imposed time-lines, the other didn't combat this, but comforted it. The expectations would be flexible to fit our current capacities, and frictions became places to orient from and to learn each other's needs and approaches. These social politics, ways of relating and maintaining crip infrastructure became important to show in the work. To make it present in the background of the work we added comment sections in the html of the poem, showing our conversations of making time and space for this crip stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here I return again and again to imagine where we can find joy in rubbing up against each other's supports and restraints in relation, and how this practice is a language we all have to practise and build capacity for independently. It is a language of sensing what each other's capacities, privileges, knowledges, desires and feelings are, and learning to understand them as they unfold. In a crip intersectionality I turn to this movement of coalition and interdependence in action, of bringing together divergent bodies and movements to manifest the change we as a group need now. Crip coalitions in themselves are temporary comings together of differing politics, structures, goals and needs to configure the social and technical infrastructure for change and affirmation we need now. In Ren Britton's Coalition Bouquet<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-72e870f48e624a77"><a data-footref="x20" href="02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-72e870f48e624a77" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>, they trace many of these histories and the improvised technologies, politics and communities that came together to blossom crip change together. Here these often complex, divergent and temporary coalitions can move beyond the predetermining confines of pain, which they may be in, to where they can reorient the issues of intersectional access to make room to hold the possibility of joyous direct action and change.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this research, this has been taken up as working between different departments, institutions, collective, projects, coalitions, mailing lists, servers and etherpads. Most importantly though, for me as a person with fatigue, chronic pain and other complicating factors, this has meant pushing for accessible ways of managing and maintaining collective practices, and trying to introduce a disorienting crip axis to (dis)align with. This inquiry has been about intersectionally and interdependently reorienting practices, figures, timelines, expectations, infrastructures and priorities. In particular, inquiring into how I can question my own role in these dynamics to support crip politics, both in our organisation and by making them accessible to collaborators. I am also taking this up in response to broader questions of interdependence within the networks, infrastructures, and politics these  collaborations manifest and are held in place by.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

It looks to complicate the way that disability is represented and mediated, moving on from both the medical model and social model of disability, to one that can hold the diversity of intersections queer and disabled bodies experience as well as making room to critique the wider implications of a cure narrative. In the medical model of disability, as Kafer notes, quoting Simi Linton, "the proper approach to disability is to "'treat' the condition and the person with the condition rather than 'treating' the social processes and policies that constrict disabled people's lives."" (2013, 5). The medical model treats the sickness or "abnormality" of disabled people on an individual basis and in doing so ignores and invalidates the background to their potentially disabling social relation. In doing this the medical model also ignores the experiences of disabled people whose bodies are not only most affected by these orientations, but also have the affective and situated knowledges that are essential to their nuanced affirming care. The medical model sees that "solving the problem of disability, then, means correcting, normalising, or eliminating the pathological individual" (Ibid, 5). A cure here can mean returning to being "able bodied" but it can also be interpreted as society being cured of disabled bodies. This medical model draws a line that forces disabled people to one side, and off of the table systematically through isolating them from it financially (Ibid, 39), as well as through eugenic regimes of genetic selection (Ibid, 76) and curing ideologies of technological enhancement (Ibid, 107).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A later and more accepted model within the disabled community is the social model, which aims to draw attention to the social aspects and the background of disability that the medical model invalidates. It does this through an 'impairment/disability' axis, which makes room to understand what a person is capable of and how a society/system can limit their abilities relationally. To do this the social model defines impairment as "any physical or mental limitation" (Ibid, 7) and argues that "disability signals the social exclusions based on, and social meanings attributed to, that impairment" (Ibid, 7). Kafer sums it up simply: "impairments aren't disabling, social and architectural barriers are" (Ibid, 7). This is in many ways generative for re-approaching disability's "problems", moving them from the individual to societal, infrastructural and political scales.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With Susan Wendell, Kafer queries the social model by asking, "how far one must be able to walk to be considered able-bodied" (Ibid, 7). While seemingly simple, this question opens many political and relational queries. What are the geographies (are there smooth walkways on flat-ish land?), economics (could they afford the walking aid or pain relief tablets?) community relations (was their friend free and able to help, or community carer available?), politics (are their medications legal?) and infrastructures (were they able to connect to a community, was an input valid on a form?). These questions move the approach away from a standardised test on an individual, and into understanding the nuances of disabling political dynamics on people's abilities, relationally and societally. Wendell and Kafer consider both impairment and disability to be socially constructed, as bodies are only seen as disabled in relation to sedimented "able" ones. Returning to Ahmed, we could ask how Crips line up to the determinate straight able-bodied line or axis? And Crips would probably respond, "huh? what axis?", or, maybe on another day, feeling more provocative, "We don't have to!"</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer also notes that the social model, when taken to an extreme, inverts the orientation of the medical model, and in doing so can invalidate people with disabilities. An example is of those disabled people who acknowledging their pain or other impairments may have a desire for a cure to them, but this in the social model could be read as playing into the medical models' narrative of a cure they are trying to counter. In this inversion it can also overlook the fact that some disabilities, such as chronic health, pain and fatigue, will not change no matter how much we change social relations. Along this thread the social model also negates to contemplate how a cure narrative towards a particular (abled) kind of body can affect people who might not identify as disabled or be "impaired". Kafer gives the examples of anti-ageing creams that can play on the anxieties of getting old as well as growth hormones for shorter children to make them "normal" height. Both can be understoon as ableist and reliant on a curative model. From this orientation, we can understand how the social model orients disability to be delineated along fine lines, and in many ways undermines the radical knowledges of disabled experiences and the relations they can put in reach.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer proposes the political/relational model to reorient the social model's impairment/disability axis. Kafer's model asks what immediate changes to relations not only validate, but also ease and make room to build up the capacities of people living with experiences of disability, neurodiversity, chronic illness and pain "under any circumstances" (Ibid, 41), which I go on to discuss further in the next section on Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In action, navigating disability through these models can be quite sad, as we understand how overwhelming these social and institutional politics and pressures are on our crip bodyminds, and how violent, forceful and invalidating they are in action. However, by making room to navigate and analyse these institutional tables and their bodily horizons from a crip orientation, we are able to set out our own paths to move around the sinkholes and vacuums they hold in place to erase our lives, experiences and voices from the discourse about disabled people and our place in the future. In this research this takes the form of questioning how I have collectively organise around and with technology, away from curative narratives of efficiency and control within these institutional politics, and instead towards collective care, maintenance and access towards our own crip social and technical infrastructures.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">02.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-6" style="z-index: 14;
