or inflection that disorients both this researchers path and their use of configuration as method. It inflects this research from inquiring into the dialogues of centralised plans to instead orient toward  interdependent practices of configuring life affirming infrastructures from site of impact. Through forming a genealogy of configuration, and then inflecting it with a crip -able, I aim to have set a new background to configure out the rest of this thesis inquiries from., and one that centres places of impact and the design frictions that emerge in action. In the next chapters I take these Configure-Able Methods into deeper collective inquiries. In these inquiries I form a more nuanced and situated understanding of what practising critical access across multiple technical and social domains made know-able to collaborators and I around our practices of collective configuration. In doing this I aim to show how we can practice disability discourse not as a single issue topic, or where we have to participate in or assimilate to determinate dialogues, but instead centre critical access as a generative place to improvise community infrastructures around and configure interdependent life affirming futures from.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">05.03.00_Conclusion</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-6" style="z-index: 3; transform: translate(240px, -1600px); width: 1000px; height: 520px; --canvas-node-width: 1000px; --canvas-node-height: 520px;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h1 heading-wrapper"><h1 data-heading="Configure-able methods" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Configure-able_methods">Configure-able methods</h1><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This chapter covers the initial inquiry of my research, and the coalescing together of crip theory and critical access with that of Feminist Science and Technologies Studies (STS). In this chapter I wiggle together these research tables to make room for Configure-able methods to emerged from this research. This inquiry does feel a little like a second literature review in some places, and this is because I wanted to centre my approach from Crip studies within <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> and in this chapter coalesce this with more of an accessible understanding of Feminist STS methods. To emerge this methodology I first trace a genealogy of configuration from its routes in figure and figuring (Lury et al., 2022) to that of Suchman’s definition of Configuration (2012). I then disorient it with an -able and critiques of critical access (Hamraie, 2017) and crip studies (Kafer, 2013) to question how configuration can be shaped when brought into contact with the dispersed and indeterminate practices, bodies and expertise of access in action. In reflection of my experiences configuring access for the <em>Configure-Able Infrastructures</em> workshops I ran at NEoN I offer how critical access as a practice and method centres indeterminate localities and imperfect improvisations instead of the determined curative hard plans which forcefully shapes bodies and systems. With both Hamraie and Kafer, I question what the problem is within configurations, cripping it from isolated individualised issues to relational constraints of centralised plans. With this disorientation I also question how sedimented roles of user/designer/expert, prescribed/prescriber, or ethnographer/community can be reconfigured from the sites of impact and frictions within collective practices.  </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">05.00_Intro</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-5" style="z-index: 4; transform: translate(-1120px, 1378px); width: 720px; height: 551px; --canvas-node-width: 720px; --canvas-node-height: 551px;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Science Technology Studies (STS) Axis" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Science_Technology_Studies_(STS)_Axis"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Science Technology Studies (STS) Axis</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In Suchman’s essay (ibid.) she gives two examples both covering self-proclaimed bench mark digital infrastructure projects within health. The first inquiry around an speculative one fits all data management system for one of the largest health management organisation (HMO) in the US by Judith Gregory (2000) and the second around the government of rural Andhra Pradesh (India) and their implementation of  their ‘Vision 2020’ policy, which undertook the implementation of a new health information infrastructures and documented by C. R. Ranjini (2007; 2006). I closely read into these two inquiries later in the <a class="internal-link" data-href="05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section in this chapter, but Suchman brings them together to offer up and reflect on their misfitting between plans and actions, or in these examples the determined datafied figures and their indeterminate material backgrounds. In both examples Suchman shares that these systems inevitably fail, not because their task of creating comprehensive healthcare tools is impossible, but because of the efficient, normalising, and reductive imaginaries and politics that they were operated through. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As I shared earlier in this chapter with the brief summary of configuration Suchman uses this framework to think through how the figures, metrics and imaginaries, work in action. With configuration she brings together both the ways in which “technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technical artefacts” (Suchman 2012, 48). In doing this she brings in-line how we plan, imagine and narrate things being done (often sedimented from a centralised, generalised and prescribed approach), with how it is situated through localised practises and material bodily horizons. By bringing these things in-line she aims to form configuration as a method of analysis which can making sense of the reverberations and frictions between situated knowings of systems through practise and the roles and figures which they can be reconfigured through. These two inquiries present this reverberation on each of their own system and infrastructure's bodily horizon to offer up what configuration as method is, and demonstrating how their sedimented norms can be radically disoriented through contingent practises of configuration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The language I use at the end of the last paragraph is intentionally muddled with Ahmed’s from <em>Queer Phenomenology</em> (2006). This is not only because Ahmed’s work frames my research but also because Suchman’s configuration is also framed through Ahmed’s theories. Instead of <em>Queer Phenomenology</em> though, Suchman builds up from Ahmed’s figure of “the stranger”(2000). In this analysis she shares how Ahmed forms the stranger not as one who is unknown, but instead is recognised as the stranger. Much like the line that divides the family table, that I talk about closely in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a>, Suchman takes up Ahmed’s line of inherited delineation to show how “inside(r)s and outside(r)s” are drawn and sedimented. Suchman works with this to show how “the stranger” is formed through citing Marx’s commodity fetishism and reorients it into ‘a fetishism of figures’(Ahmed 2000, 4) that can hold the fantasy and materiality of things together in a plastic form. Suchman later in the essay follows up this figure of the stranger by asking how to trouble the divide between user/designer/expert, and the inherent division between those who can configure out systems for strangers and those how have to live by strangers' figures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Working from these two examples Suchman defines configuration through a rigid STS axis. This aims to take up examples which situate the work by embedding the STS expert within the field, through interviews, shadowing practitioners and researching paperwork. In some ways being embedded here for STS still means being a stranger, as quality research is only achieved through an exterior expert collating information to figure out these configurations reverberations. Suchman would debate this, as she does in her essay with Karen Barad’s notion of “Agency”(2007)<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-bec9de4660b83a42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-bec9de4660b83a42"><a data-footref="2b" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-bec9de4660b83a42" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup> where she reminds us that we are entangled within the apparatus no matter our delineation. I very much agree with this but within the framework set out with Ahmed’s table, I ask how much is in reach from these rigid STS positions? And how can I disorient configuration by making room for my communities to reverberate between our matters and how we figure them out.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Especially in the context of this research, of refusing big tech complicity and figuring out other approaches to cloud computing and community infrastructures, it could be asked why not turn to a more recent example of configuring methods? It would be very logical to look to something like Louise Amoore's <em>Cloud Ethics</em> (2020), where the centralised role of the expert is dispersed to those in touch with each other and the infrastructures. Her methodology also aligns with mine, where these challenges are made through counter figures, of telling narratives or stories, making songs and contextualising configurations in messy localities. I instead take this step back to Suchman's configuration (2012) not just because it helps to accessibly demonstrate the genealogy of configuration, but also as she takes up disabled matters, and life-affirming infrastructures. I later go on to show in cripping configuration that both Suchman and Amoore still seem to negate and invalidate disabled voices, politics and theory within their dialogues. In the next section's inquiry I firstly offer up how practices of critical access are in themselves radical impact centred configuring practices, and ones that configuring life-affirming infrastructures. In doing this I then return to this STS axis to share the necessity of this inflection of access, and why indeed we need to centre crip politics and practices in these debates, not negate and invalidate them.</p></div><div></div><div>

Lury et al. (ibid., 8) define configuring as a practice within complex systems design that makes room to join diverse elements into arrangement, never final even when "stable". It doesn’t refer to the final arrangement of components, but instead this practise of coalescing them together. Due to configuring being this process of bringing figures into action, as well as bringing the diverse elements of infrastructure together, it has been taken up by Science Technology Studies (STS) as a cornerstone critical methodology and mode of analysis. Lury et al.&nbsp;here points to Lucy Suchman’s definition of Configuration to demonstrate how this methodology can make room to inquire with “[a]t once action and effect”(2012, 49). Suchman’s definition makes room to understand how the stories that are told and the figures that are held in place produce specific sedimented practices of ordering. In configuration as method she makes room for a mode of analysis that can be an un/remaking through material practises and their knowledges. Lury et al.&nbsp;go on to trace configuration through the work of D. N. Rodowick (2001), Michel Foucault’s notion of similitude(2020), as well as Donna Haraway’s “string figures”(1997) and her Cyborg Manifesto (1985), which I touch on more in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. These movements by Lury et al.&nbsp;in many ways orients towards their understanding of Elizabeth Povinelli (2016) and Michelle Murphy (2017) work as practices of forming figures “equal to contemporary political configurations”(Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 10). Configure-Able Methods as I will go on to offer up, moves with these approaches of forming counter figures, but also (un)fixes these practices through impact centred design methods of critical access. Here making room to form wiggle room through these counter figures to disorient configurations from their sites of impact and friction.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To understand the importance of the (un)fixing and disorientation of -able further I am going to return to Suchman’s definition in her Configuration essay (2012) that Lury et al.&nbsp;touches on. This deeper reading of Suchman’s Configuration is due to it making room for me to understand why and how my research finds the need to disorient configuration through impact centred critical access methods and my disobedient methods. In doing this I am not aiming to de-legitimise this field, or Suchman's work, but to dance with them and to trouble the sedmineted norms they emerge from. In fact Suchman is taken up here as a refined version of STS, and an axis of STS for which I can disobediently crip and disorient configuration from. The other key reason for choosing Suchman’s definition is that in this essay she takes up medical infrastructures and with them the infrastructures of disability. Much like Alison Kafer’s taking up of disability within Haraway’s cyborg, which I discuss in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. I am taking up a definition of configuration where disability is in the background but not yet made known or brought in reach of the research. Here I am making wiggle room within these STS methods for the disabled figure to emerge and with them disobediently bringing their crip politics, methods, practices and approaches.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">05.01.02.00_Configuration</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-5" style="z-index: 6; transform: translate(-480px, -440px); width: 720px; height: 606px; --canvas-node-width: 720px; --canvas-node-height: 606px;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Figuring out a Genealogy of Configuration" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Figuring_out_a_Genealogy_of_Configuration"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Figuring out a Genealogy of Configuration</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Like much of the work I am engaged with, Configure-able methods are an attempt to enact methods, practices and their terms so that they can be accessible to and improvised by different positions.

In the intro chapter to their <em>Figure Concept and Method</em> book they define two propositions of figure, one as a noun and one as a verb. The difference in the two is key, as I will share, as it takes us from passive and inherited determined figures, and stories of a world, to being able to figure out our own stories and relations with each other and technologies.</p></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="As a noun, Figure" dir="auto" class="heading" id="As_a_noun,_Figure"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>As a noun, Figure</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To define figure as a noun, they first build up from Erich Auerbach’s (2013) tracing of its etymology within “Figura” in Latin. Figura developed from a constellation of technical Greek words that orient the materiality of things and plays between plasticity and form within their shaping. Auerbach raises the tension within Figura which came about to think through this delineation of both the material and conceptual elements of an object. In a sense this meant that within western discourse Figura, or later figures, became a place to pivot or orient our understanding of the material through the conceptual. Figures are sedimented into christian doctrine, where stained in glass they can be understood as a way of forming futures from pasts<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-e8a89a291dce739a"><a data-footref="1a" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, making prophesy from historic fables. Quoting Hayden White, Lury et al.&nbsp;states that the use of figures to represent this exchange is “Western culture’s unique achievement of identifying reality as history”(1999, 96). In this motion of prefiguring, Auerbach understands a flow of figuring that deterministically moves into set configurations of material practices and the limited scoping of their possibility.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When brought into the fields of social and political studies Figures are used in multiple ways. Lury et al. highlights Norbert Elias (1987) as a sociologist who focuses on the relationality and interdependence of persons and the ways this can figure their configuration. In his work he states it is the role of a social scientist to understand how these configurations bind them to their subject another (ibid., 79). This understanding of figures as relational practices forms the base for figurational sociology. In these figurational practices we start to understand that figures are not determined prototypes, but act as stories in motion, plastic and performable. Lury runs through a few of these performances of figures in relation, moving from an isolated and disinterested flâneur by Charles Baudelaire through to Walter Benjamin’s crowd (2003). In doing this she not only shares the plasticity of the figure, but also how in their relationality they are lived through.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The final critique Lury et al. (2022, 4) make of the figure as a noun is of its western context, of the list of white men referenced to manifest it here in writing. In the most part, they point out that within this relational practice of the figure is a practice of differencing and division<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-e8a89a291dce739a"><a data-footref="2a" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-2-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>. To examine this division further they take up Alexander G. Weheliye’s critique of “racialisation” (2014) as a crucial axis. With Weheliye they question sedimented figures by moving from following what they scope to questioning how they are scoped. Through this inversion of their approach to figures it can be understood as a probing tool, one for reflecting on and feeling out our means of producing knowledge.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Interestingly this movement of inverting the figure to understand its maker also resonates with the move of the social model of disabilitie’s inversion of the medical model which I talk more about in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model</a> entry. In this move the social model's inversion of sedimented power relations and their practices, even though useful to understand certain aspects of power, can in some ways miss the nuance of relations. With a crip approach I look to trouble this by exploring how a figure can of course be inverted, but also what other relations and practices can I make room for when I choose to feel the frictions between figures and their backgrounds.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="As a verb, Figuring" dir="auto" class="heading" id="As_a_verb,_Figuring"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>As a verb, Figuring</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Figuring as a verb takes on the action of forming figures, of figuring things out and of composing or computing figures. within this diversity of forms and use of figure there is a focus on the tactility of thinking when we are working through them. Taken as method figuring makes room to apprehend the shape of something, of feeling out a figure, collating one together, and making wiggle room for another one to join. In this figuring out of space, much like with the noun, is this division of what is brought into being a figure and what is backgrounded to contour that figure. Lury et al. approaches this with Edgar Rubin’s psychological research into perception (1958), where his depiction of figure and ground are defined by the “contour” that runs between them. They give the example of the “Rubin vase”<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-e8a89a291dce739a"><a data-footref="3a" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-3-e8a89a291dce739a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup>. With Ahmed I could similarly ask what contingent approaches and practises do I rely upon, turning back to them when feeling out contours of bodily-horizons, as I have not found another path I yet desire, or another background to figure out from. This is especially true within disability studies where the figure of the crip is only just disobediently emerging into discourse of other fields, and has always been kept in the background. With my crip figuring out it is to make wiggle room around these sedimented norms for this disabled figure to be contoured among, and with it the demands of critical access and disobedient relational politics of crip theory.</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

This has led me to reflect deeply on access-knowledge not only as a flexibility and capacity we build up around institutions and their norms through practice but also as one of the most divergent sites of impact to reconfigure complex systems from. By inquiring into access knowledge as configuration in practise, I aim to share how disability studies has inform my capacities for making room for the indeterminate needs and material limits of people and technologies around the sedimented norms of institutions. I have already written a lot on the many times I have encountered frictious access prepared by others and made me feel out of place, like at the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.01_The_research_table</a>, <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02_The_computing_table</a> or the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, or access that has made me feel understood and affirmed in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.04_The_crip_table</a>. Here though, I find it more pressing to share my experiences and inquiries around forming access with and for others, as well as reflecting on my requesting of access from institutions as reconfiguring practicises. Inquiring into these orientations, of both access requester towards institutions and collective provider within community work, I aim to trouble the sedimented division of user/designer/expert roles in practises of configuring access. This inquiry gives shape to configure-able methods, and how I aim to approach and care for these normalised institutional limits, forming wiggle room within and around them. In doing this though, I also aim to not so easily collapse pre-configure roles, like users, workshop participants and presenter, but instead be intimate with the intersectional capacities of those involved and how each person can orient themselves in locality together to configure collective access. </p></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Collective Access-Knowledge as Configuration" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Collective_Access-Knowledge_as_Configuration"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Collective Access-Knowledge as Configuration</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To render this inquiry around Configure-Able methods I will focus on an initial attempt to meet people's access needs at a workshop I ran and which has inform the initial emergence of these methods. This was a workshop called Configure-Able Infrastructures I organised with NEoN digital. This was both my first attempt at a UKRI funded Knowledge Exchange (KE) but more importantly here, it was my first clear attempt at putting on an accessible workshop, and so has given me many misfittings, frictions and disorienting factors to reflect and learn from. These workshops were manifested as a place to explore and exchange dialogues of digital accessibility outside of big tech services, and was hosted by NEoN Digital Arts, a community based organisation focusing on digital access. I invited two groups to share their work. One was M.E.L.T. a crip digital arts collaboration of Ren Britton and Iz Paehr, presenting their Access Server work. The other person I invited was Ai Carmela from SysterServer to accessibly share technical skills of feminist network practices. These workshops in retrospect worked out okay for my first attempt at an accessible workshop, but left me quite anxious about how well I had managed it. This was in part not just because access in action is a steep learning curve when coming from the ableist norms of academic institutions and open-source community alike. From these institutions, flexibility is not asked but silently/violently demanded of the user, students, researchers or person approaching them, as our soft crip bodies and needs are stretched to fit the valid normid user's capacities and form. This being said these frictions and misfittings provide a quality example of how access-knowledge understood as configuration can be a generative tool for analysing the relations, politics, norms and imaginaries holding the current configurations of systems in place and which don't let them contextually flex to the soft bodies or needs they come in touch with in context.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The focus of this inquiry is to reflect on the demands for bodies to be flexible by both academic and open-source institutional inflexibility in action. I also focus on the response to institutional inflexibility and the room for flexibility within the constellation of producers and presenters running the workshop. In this I aim to demonstrate how institutional norms reinforce roles of user/designer, prescribed/prescriber, where as communities actioned through forms of critical access can make wiggle room within how they contextualising their roles and relations beyond what is sedimented as inflexible. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I will begin by orienting towards the workshops use of Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). I as an organiser had decided to try to run the workshop using FLOSS platforms and services hosted by different communities. This was mainly out of curiosity of what access was possible within FLOSS, but also to attempt a refusal to flex to the ableist norms of academia and big tech. The friction we had here originated from M.E.L.T. but reverberated among us, and came about due to this being an online workshop where we wanted to provide people with captions to access the workshops. The budget for this KE event was limited, so I oriented towards using auto-captions, and paying the presenters what I could. In trying to configure out a FLOSS video call with auto-captioning, I realised that this just did not exist (within reach). Default installs of Jiitsi did not have it, and even though there was some documentation on how to do it, I had not found an instance of it. With Big Blue Button (BBB) it had room for manual captioning but no wiggle room to automate it. This absence was overpowering in some ways, and showed how the Ableist norms of FLOSS did not centre accessibility or find it central to its future development. Access is very much was extra time for FLOSS. It also surfaces that if we want to be flexible to people's access needs we have to all flex to the inflexible politics, relations and protocols of big tech as the "one best way". Here though we refused their inflexibility and instead oriented towards forming access around FLOSS and away from big tech. To do this I providing a detailed “how to” for setting up a captioning system on a local machine. This sharing of knowledge and improvising of infrastructure made wiggle room for flexibility around how people improvise configurations of access-able alternatives to complicit big tech platforms. It also shares how through collaborative action we both felt design frictions, but made room to bridge that gap, improvise and flex the hard machines to wiggle some room within these misfittings for one afternoon. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From this friction also came a generative conversation with Sabrina at NeoN, talking about auto-captioning compared to live captioning by a professional person or sonographer. We talked about how live-captioning by a person is not only more accurate but is itself a practice and an art form where they can add in more context but also creativity in the way they represent the dynamics and relations of what is being said. Here I did not want to replace the people who practice these vibrant and generative art forms, professions, and practitioners knowledges with clumsy and uniformed automation. When I think through access oriented like this, and as centring art and creaivity it again transforms the narrative of access from one of a burden and constraint, to one of joy and pleasure. In Lousie Hickman's video essay <em>Crip AI</em> (2021), she takes this into even closer detail to question how these histories of crip centred practices of sonographers are being overuled and left out of the dialogue when automating their practices and creative captions. Hamraie also shares how this is something of a norm when industrial design models approach disability, or even across fields. This is where these approaches do not navigate the methods, context or history of a field but just bluntly apply their own one best way of efficient design to it.   </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With crip theory this unquestioned and prescribed move to the automation of access can also be understood as being more about relational politics which forcefully isolating disabled people by investing in ways to reduce funds for creative and intimate human centred practices of access-knowledge, care and joy within disabled lives. This isn't to say we shouldn't invest in their development, or to exclude the disabled people that might prefer these technologies to a person, but it is to make space for the option. It is like Hickman's Crip AI, which lays down the terms of if this is happening to us, we are making room in it to bring are backgrounds with us.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Being honest in these workshops it was a mix of institutional inflexibility from KE funds to not support this type of access by default but also my unknowing of how to access more funds that led me to improvise this automated access. Here though instead of have the capacity to make room for better access and the captioning as art and joy full, we did manifest ways to form automated access without being entangled in the complicit "one best way" of big tech. With this I aim to demonstrate how these access frictions not only formed a generative place for us to locally and collectively analyse the configuration of automated creative captions and FLOSS, but also materially configure our own improvised alternatives then and there.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From another orientation emerged a second friction from this workshop, with just as much inflexibility but this time coming from the academic institution. This friction came from the simple action of getting funds to pay individuals that had already been awarded to me to run from UKRI through the KE scheme. This fairly simple task became inaccessible to me, not because the money was not declared, but because the process itself was not clear or accessible, leaving me un-agential and unable to do this simple task. The background to this moment is that efficiently my departments admin team had been fired and they had hired new people but not trained them. In doing so made the practices they were hired to do inaccessible to both them and to requesting staff like me. In my context this meant spending months emailing back and forth with these admin "experts" trying to get them to pay the participants the money that was allocated for them. The lack of access here was shown in how I, as an early career researcher doing these things for the first time did not know exactly what to tell the admin person. In the opposite direction as a un-trained administrator, nor could they guide me to the right forms and process. In full there was no flex-ability for us to meet in the middle (even with a slight gap).</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I ended up resolving this by reaching out to my supervisor, who advised me on emailing another experienced admin who was more experienced and flexible. They managed to get the payments for participants sorted in one afternoon, slightly less that three months. Even still here there were complexities with getting some people paid due to state regulations. This shows how this configuration of knowledge exchange by academic institutions and their funding bodies like UKRI only make room for certain imagined bodies or normid users to be present and felt, those that know who to ask, and what form to fill in already, no matter those let on the campus or in the state. In this inflexibility these institutions making certain other sorts of research by those not used to these sedimented processes slow to almost static. In this case here, if a person needed help accessing the administrational logics of these institutions or sit in the grey areas of state regulations you are waylaid and invalidated from sharing your knowledge, experience and practices in this ecology, or at least getting paid to do so. This systemic institutional invalidation, hiding and silencing of certain bodies and experiences is well known, but what I highlight here is that it was again us as a group who made room for and improvised a local flexible collective access within this institutional background so that it could come into contact with and be reoriented by these radical access frictions and their generative knowledges.</p></div></div></div><div class="el-h4 heading-wrapper"><h4 data-heading="Requesting Access as Configuration" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Requesting_Access_as_Configuration"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Requesting Access as Configuration</h4><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Moving on from the frictions within the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops, I now move to trouble the role of requesting access from institutions through relational and political crip demands and the room that makes for reconfiguration. Here I am reflecting on the calls for friction in the <em>Crip Tehcnoscience Maifesto</em> (Hamraie &amp; Fritsch, 2019), of making direct actions of access, of cutting curbs in barriers, politics and sociotechnical relations. Here though I want to share how requesting access to institutions on these crip terms can create wiggle room and flexibility in these hard systems not only the individuals life of the requester, but those in a wide scope of crip intersectional politics and struggle. This sees access as community leverage and interdependent resistance using these systems to enable refusal of certain politics but also most importantly care for other orientations. Hamraie and Fritsch's examples present direct action towards normalised ableist public infrastructure, but here I wiggled room into an access request I made to an institution that brought in these intersectional crip politics. This maybe aligns more with what Britton writes in <em>On Rehearsing Access</em> (Britton, 2024), and quoting Hedva's Access Rider<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-eae11157e140edcb" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-eae11157e140edcb"><a data-footref="1m" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-eae11157e140edcb" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, where they ask what real and permanent change their demands of access can make to institutions. The request I am reflecting on here is when I produced an audio piece for Tate’s electric dream FM on crip big-tech disobedience, where I talked about fermenting foods and feelings as a crip erotic technology. This was their accessible audio exhibition that accompanied the Electric Dreams retrospective, which presented an impressive catalogue of arts at the intersection of science and technology before the internet. Here in this extra time around the exhibition for access, I used this platform to not only highlight crip erotics of care, embodied practice and disobedient relational refusal, but most importantly here, test what access as a request can enable when thought understood as intersectionaly political. This in many ways is only a small movement but it highlights the configuring leverage, flex-ability and wiggle room a user can request and make within an institution.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Part of their default contract asked for me was to agree that my recording be published by them for promotion on multiple big tech social media platforms. I decided to test how a relational access request, one of refusing certain violent politics and infrastructures would be negotiated by this institution. To do this I asked within my access rider/requests that my recorded material boycott and not be shared on google’s platforms. I would have liked to have tried to boycott more of the big tech groups for their complicity to and enabling of many of the ongoing mass disablements and the ableist norms of efficient automation and the futures they enact. I thought to try small though and see what wiggle room this sedimented context and hardened institution had capacity for when in touch with a crip user like me. I also felt like I had more leverage to do this as they seemed to be running a little last minute, and I think I filled the “disabled voice” that lacked from the “accessible platform”. After the request things went quiet for a few days, but after a little time I got a reply and contract with this boycott formalised in writing (+@fig:google). I know this is a small gesture, and one that in many ways may have not made much change, but it opens up again to demonstrate the capacity intersection crip access riders and their requests have within configuring practice, both politically, relationally and materially. In this small gesture is the promise that access as a disobedient request can make institutions wiggle, make space, and be in dialogue with relational understandings of access.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="A screen shot from a contract between me and Tate displaying a &quot;Note&quot; disclaiming it cannot be shared on platforms run by Google LLC" src="../05_media/google excemption.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="A screen shot from a contract between me and Tate displaying a &quot;Note&quot; disclaiming it cannot be shared on platforms run by Google LLC" src="05_configure-able_methods/05_media/google-excemption.png" target="_self"></span>{#fig:google}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">These inquiries into configure-able methods and configuring access aim to give an insight into how crip studies and access-knowledge can reconfigure configuration. They have set a basis to rethink how the boundary between user/designer, requester/provider and body/institution are delineated. In the de-sedimentation of delineation it moves us from a need to cure the other or invalidate the frictions felt from boundaries but instead care for how we can oriented towards and make room for access to transform the sedimented inflexibility of institutions. These methods orients to groups in context collectively feeling out material relations and caring for their limits in a way that generates unknowable possibilities. Each action of access an affirmation of life, each affirmation a promise of a crip future to come.</p></div><div></div><div>

In this moving from that of the straight axis of STS and towards a crip queering of these methods. Part of this is to bring these methods in-touch with the framework of this project, but also as mentioned is to take up discourse of disability within feminist theory and configuration management, where it has been present but unmentioned. The latter move again informed by Kafer’s work discussed in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, taking up disability in discourse where it is seen but not felt. Again by cripping the axis of configuration, and disobediently orienting it towards an abundance of crip futures, I am not discrediting the great work of Suchman, but setting it to another background and in reach of figures and practices of disability that can disorient its sedimented norms. This disorienting of configuration for me is an action of the internal arch’s of this researcher’s inquiry. It is to think through how I relate to and practice organisational practices and theory through my embodied knowledge’s of crip methods and politics. It is also for crip studies to make room for me to feel how these internal ripples diffract, build up and make an impression  and inflection on the path I take towards and from configuration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here I reflect on the earlier two examples of configuration that Suchman offers up to inflect their methods of critiquing the differences between the prescribed plan and the situated actions of complex sociotechnical systems, and in this how expertise are figured to roles and distributed. The first thing that has to be noted here within her reflections of these inquiries is the absence of disabled voices, theory and experiences within this dialogues. Both clearly touch upon care systems, whether they were experimental data management systems or the actioning of metrified management of state care. Both of these case studies are well within reach of crip politics and lives. On looking throughout the paper the closest word to disability from a word search is fittingly that of “disappear” within the scentence:</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“In this sense, the method assemblage of configuration could be understood as a device for articulating the relation between the ‘insides’ of a socio-technical system and its constitutive ‘outsides’, including all of those things that disappear in the system’s figuration as an object” (Suchman 2012, 55)</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is not to say that Suchman is intentionally disappearing disabled bodies and their experiences from configuring practices, but that the norms of institutional logics place them as outsiders of their own discourse. With Hamraie, I could also provocatively read this as disabled practices of interdependence and embodied politics would trouble the neutrality of this STS axis too much (2017, p. 50), so are overruled to define a straight(er) line. Either reading, and the situated actions of Suchman’s definition have left disabled people un-agential and disabled within dialogues of their own life giving infrastructures. Below I take a closer reading of the two examples Suchman offers to highlight how crip politics could disorient these sedimented methods and wiggle them closer to my crip table and politics of life affirmation.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">With Ranjini’s analysis of the “Vision 2020” scheme, Suchman’s focus on situated actions orients those of healthcare professionals in the field. This scoping only shows how these people have to cut corners, make up figures and hack metrics to maintain care within their districts. This scoping, even though showing a clear separation between plans of state management and situated actions of care on the ground, does not make room for the people who had to be a corner that was cut. Neither does it make room to highlight the violence that was enacted to people in need of care when their district was punished for not hitting targets and so given ill funding. In the silencing of disabled experience here is the lack of a crip critique on these dynamics. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here I aim to disorient these through both crip theories political relational model's expansive critique of cure narratives that Kafer offers (2013). In many ways the same methods of the medical model of disability are also implicated to those working within the infrastructure and organisation of healthcare in rural Andhra Pradesh, southern India. In Ranjini’s example the system was prescribed to be cured of problems of inefficiencies by neo-liberal efficiency logics of datafication and target hitting. This meant a few things, firstly that the problem is isolated within the health care system and secondly  the “treatment” given to cure it are data figure, metrics and targets. This is apparent in Ranjini's notes, where even though acknowledged by those having to hit them as semi-impossible in relation to the resources provided and the situated material relations of people and space, those figure, metrics and targets were still the only legitimate dialogue that could be had. These organisational practices from “district meetings revealed no opportunity for health workers or supervisors to provide explanations as to why targets could not be met, or to inform the setting of more appropriate ones through”(Ibid, 54). And the efficient logics inevitably led to penal systems where “If they do not achieve targets, they are punished. [Of course], there is no reward. The reward is not being punished.”(Ranjini 2007, 113). This system’s configuration turning to a treatment of a penal reward system similar to that often used towards disabled people, from the ugly law through to the eugenic persecution of “feeble-minded” (Kafer 2013, 30–32). These penal logics also utalised by the AGI promises that I touch on in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md" href="../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction. These are figure to promise to emerge generalised intellignece and an ability to understand the unknown through automating these same penal logics. Through a crip understanding of the political/relational model though, these penal logics can be interpreted as disabling any relation they are introduced into. They do this by reducing the complex and nuanced relations of situated actions and embodied practices that sociotechnical systems emerge from down to a win/loose, valid/invalid equation. In doing so setting out a determinate action space and reducing the metrics of success to singular goals that are often unattainable within the material limits. The main issue my crip critique has is how these logics disables the reading of any alternative feedback or approach other than the desired unattainable goals/metrics and by default not intimate with what it is being put in touch with or impacting. Much like Ruha Benjamin’s critique of datafication of the injustice<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-83dd16eebb9b8f0e" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-83dd16eebb9b8f0e"><a data-footref="2d" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-83dd16eebb9b8f0e" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, and my own experiences of these dynamics at <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.02_The_computing_table</a>, these systems and their policies prioritises data over everything else. With an analysis of crip time we can also understand this as gate-keeping needs from being met until the perfect data or cure (that is unachievable) is achieved, and in the process invalidating, irradicating and curing the unsqueezable bugs, temporary errors and ugly data within the system.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The second example Suchman gives of Judith Gregory’s analysis of the HMO’s experimental data management system, similarly frames disabled people out of the dialogue. This is firstly through the works mapping of the different groups figured to be valid voices within the development of the data management system. Seemingly following the scoping set out by the HMO, the only valid groups are the HMO, the technical developers and the medical professionals. The closest they come to scoping in the disabled experience of care and their opinion is through the patient’s data, which is figured to be “always ready-to-hand”(Suchman 2012, 57). Echoing my own experience of being “cleen ready-to-use” for <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, this scoping misses the violence, objectification and industrialisation of care that such an efficient imaginary entails. This forceful shaping of the disabled bodies and patients into users in ready-to-use configurations painfully emanates the eugenic histories the Hamraie brings up with the flexible user (2017). This invalidation of voice and experience undermines the scoping of this configuration’s analysis, and for me begs for crip disobedient intervention. It is a place for me to refuse the expectation to be “always ready-to-hand” or "cleen reedy-to-use", and instead step out of line and question how I can situate plans and action from the sites of impact. In doing this giving those at greatest risk as well as benefit, access to and agency over how their infrastructures can affirm their current lives.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Searching for alternatives methods of configuration within Gregory’s critique of the HMO’s Suchman highlights how Grgory takes up Helen Verran’s notion of “working knowledges together”. In this notion Verran is figuring out methods to bring together indigenous people and a colonial state with very different imaginaries, capacities, practices and their knowledges into other intermediary spaces for dialogue. Gregory and Suchman highlight these indigenous land right discourses and methods as a way to think through how to disorient the power relations within plans, protocols and their negotiations. Verran’s “working knowledges together” is itself very interesting and has informed how I approach discourse and power relations within my approach to collective practices, but within the discourse of care systems it leaves me asking for a little more. This is not to say that indigenous studies is not applicable to disability discourse, it very much is in the ways that it, along with other positionalities, multiplies the crip experiences as I have mentioned in the <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> and <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> sections. Instead here specifically I wondered more why when they were looking outside of the medical management discourse and to disorient it, they didn’t move to critical-access or disability studies? Why not turn to Hamraie's critique of the flexible user (which wasn't written yet)? or to Sins in-valid's intersectional collective practices? Of coalition politics of disabled folks that go back decades? and of life affirming access practices and their knowledges? Here when Suchman and Gregory turn to the other outside of their western academic norms, they miss the other being directly impacted by the system they are inquiring into. With this -able inflection I aim to disorient the normative access of STS that holds in place these bodily horizons through these determined roles and invalidating relations. In doing this I not only start to practice how crip theory and its methods, politics and practices can disorient the norms, roles and divides of expertise in configuration practices, but also how it makes room for configuration to feedback from embodied collective practices, and ones that care for the sites of impact within configurations. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Returning to Amoore's (2020) update of configuration, we can also witness how in many ways she makes room for this distribution of roles from the axis of user/designer, STS expert/practitioner, prescriber/prescribed, to move to those of interdependent and collective narrative making from the sites of impact and through many orientations, approaches and capacities. In this though she still manages to negate disability studies as being a place to pull from, instead turning to almost every other marginalised group but disability<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-83dd16eebb9b8f0e" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-83dd16eebb9b8f0e"><a data-footref="3d" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-2-83dd16eebb9b8f0e" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>. When we return to her work through critical access and crip theory, we could understand partiality as capactiy, and opacity as access. This transforms partiality, to be understood as a relational materiality, where I practice within a technologies capacities by configuring them out to understand, figure out and care for their limits. It also refuses the boundary of opacity, aiming to not conflate the sedimented roles and positions of configurations, but to make room to figure out their interdependent relations and situated processes. Crip studies and critical access here provide not only another background to set these collective configuring methods from, but in doing so re-figures the approaches configuration can take towards complex sociotechnical systems and collective organisation.  </p></div><div></div><div></div><div>

To do this I aim to translate the inflection of access-able to to that of configure-able through a tracing of access-knowledge and critical access. With this disorientating inflection I aim to inform the STS methods of configuration through those of Aimi Hamraie's tracing of flexible users (2017) and their understanding of access-knowledge. To do this I take into focus my own experiences of organising access for others as well as requesting access myself as inquiries into configuring practices informed through access-knowledge.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">To start this inquiry into critical access it is interesting to first turn to -able as a suffix or as what I am calling here an inflection. -able or -ible’s etymology is traced from middle English, that comes from a French incursion of “-able”, and an empirical root in Latin with “-abilis”. This suffix’s etymology inflects  “-able” to orient towards that of being able to do something, to enter, to be free from constraint or even gifted, but more specifically worthy of doing that thing or of being free. This sedimented line of “-able” being about worth is one that we still feel to this date, where questions of disabled people being worthy of access to basic care and a standard quality of life is still seemingly an open debate in the uk <sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-7613a13151625621" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-7613a13151625621"><a data-footref="41" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-7613a13151625621" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>. Instead here, I orient to take a step back and disobediently retreat from these normative terms of -able and think through how critical access and crip studies might disorient it otherwise. Interestingly on the retreat we may pass the Old English suffix of “-endlic” that “-able” straightened out and overruled. “-endlic” instead of focusing on the value or worthiness of the subject, focuses on the material capacity. Inflecting a word with it means it is capable to, or able to do something. Why I stop here to catch a breath on the retreat is because it denotes a key aspect of critical access that I want to highlight. It is not about a person being worthy of access, but it is to orient access as a collective flexibility to do what we can materially, and to be honest and open about those flex-abilities, capacities and contours. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Kafer poses an understanding of flexibility as "not just extra time" (2013, p.27) for disabled people, where "rather than bend disabled bodies and minds to meet the clock, crip time bends the clock to meet disabled bodies and mind"(ibid, p.27). This is similarly reflected on by Aimi Hamraie's tracing of the <em>flexible user</em> and the <em>human factor</em> (2017) within eugenics, industrial engineering and ergonomics beginning in the nineteenth century. The flexible "user" traced by Hamraie emerges from mass prosthetic manufacture after the world wars and poses soft human bodies, and the emergent human factor they make up within systems design, to be malleable problems to be cured by being shape by and for hard normalising systems and their processes. This in contemporary critiques is highlighted in the work of Renyi Hong's "plasticity" (2024), but especially in his critique of curative platforms (2024). This is where big tech platforms, like "Grab, a leading superapp platform in Southeast Asia",  form narratives of disabled bodies as empowered by flexible work within a system and making room for them to choose when to work. In action thought this resulted pushing people with disabilities into precarious work and unsafe working environments, which never resulted in them having stability, agency or being empowered. It forced them to be flexible to the clock and processes of the app, and did not make room for or imagine their indeterminate bodies or their wider relational frictions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In response to these design politics Hamraie offers up the history of access-knowledge and of disabled people as knowers and makers to disorient hard machines to be flexible to softer bodies and build up the capacities within them for indeterminate crip bodies and their situated horizons. When we orient to how crip studies is practised around access in academia (Abrams, Floyd, and Abes 2024; Evans et al. 2024), and also from my own experiences of providing it, it is this place where we question the flexibility of the sedimented hard relations and politics of institutions, from the ways they conform disabled bodies within times, categories and metric figures, to how these invalidating practices validate and bring peoples needs into dialogue.</p></div><div class="el-blockquote"><blockquote dir="auto">
<p>“The disability to come . . . will and should always belong to the time of the promise. . . . it’s a crip promise that we will always comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively, somehow access other worlds and futures.”<br>
—Robert McRuer, Crip Theor (McRuer and Bérubé 2006)</p>
</blockquote></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the appendices of Feminist queer and crip Kafer (2013, 171–78) quotes McRuer above, before sharing her own materials from her practises of access. In this quote and in Kafer’s placement of it I interpret this “crip promise” that opens up crip futures as a promise of access that we make to ourselves and others around us. This promise of access for me is a call for life affirmation. It is a disorienting and inflecting action that moves towards affirming lives through emergent daily practices of access. By orienting life-affirmation on indeterminate access I don’t aim to determine what it is or can be, but aim to configure out the practices that can make room for life affirmation to be know-able through access in action. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Stating access as a promise orients not as a static set of “universal” solutions or cures, such as the historic "one best way" (2017, p. 61) that Hamraie critiques. In this practise I know this is not something I can master or cure and there will never be a determinate "one bast way" or a solution to access. As Hamraie's forms it access-knowledge is produced through "Flexible knowing (knowledge of a range of embodiments) and flexible design (designing for those embodiments)", that form needs and access outcomes from situated bodies and not generalised or prescribed normid bodies. Hamraie shares the histories of access knowledge through the reverberation of section 504, and where barrier free access started to come into equality laws. In this recollection they share the many misfitting, iterations and localisations of these laws, as disable activists tried to make room in the generalised state and international level access laws for the situated diverse needs of the people with disability within America. These range form the ways mandatory policies were made advisories when taken to other states (turned into extra time), how barrier free access was scoped towards more traditionally socially visible disabilities, and how institutionalised barrier free access also pushed for circulation and visibility of disabled people, instead of giving them agency over their lives.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This troubling and reverberating of the rulers line through access-knowledge itself comes to a position of validating the collective labours, the possibility of institutional flexibility and the situated knowledges that it takes to be in a place or relation together. Bringing this back to Kafer, she demonstrates her access-knowledge through practise of making scent free spaces, and where the expanded relational understanding of access it undertakes is explicit. This is where all participant must be intimate with this room, considerate about what they clean themselves with and how they can stay chemical free until they reach this room. With Johanna Hedva’s <em>Sick Woman Theory</em> (2016) they also think through the ways access-knowledge troubles the normative roles of activism, and asks how can their be more room for expressions from those who cannot always be there in person due to illness, capacities or other life commitments. Hedva here transforms the understanding of what it is we can offer when we show up for justice. Another recollection of the many contexts of access-knowledge in action is Ren Britton's <em>On Rehearsing Access</em> (Britton, 2024) where access riders and their request are taken up as hacking tools to make room and flexibility in communities and institutions so disabled people can thrive within them. These patterns and practices of access knowledge differ greatly from a model of centralised control seen not only in the medical model, but also politics of neo-liberal austerity and their efficiency policies and imaginaries of sociopolitical infrastructures. In Suchman’s examples as I go on to share in <a class="internal-link" data-href="05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md" href="05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, some of my own in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md" href="../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a>, as well as Ahmed and Kafer’s work that i discuss in <a class="internal-link is-unresolved" data-href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" href="../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a>, we have offered up how the pivotal action in centralised control is a holding of a determined line in place through invalidating penal logics, which almost always negate and silence the material relations, sense making and feedback of bodies. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Understanding access knowledge as a promise of flexibility instead of a checklist (Kafer 2017), approaches it as an ongoing process of situated negotiation and a radical space of flexing lines and wiggling room for crip folks to participate how they feel able and desire to. This indeterminate promise and practice of access knowledge in action can seem overwhelming in the way that it is non-prescriptive, in need of deep intimacy and care as well as often admitting to not really have the capacity to meet the full needs of people. Saying this though I have been finding comfort in returning to this -endlic inflection of -ability, turning it from worth and towards capacity. Access in these terms takes so many paths converging and diverging between communities and institutions at each situated and messy locality, lines being drawn and woven together to configure a holey tapestry. The spaces missed and gaps out of reach of our communities thread giving form and horizon to this body, forming contours around what access is and can be. Here I am inquiring into how I approach my capacities when configuring access through a critical flexibility that aims to go between these divergent points, become intimate with the lines that divides the expertise within my communities and orient to practices of going into the unknown together. </p></div><div></div><div>
