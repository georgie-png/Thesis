situate this research at the tables of my context as a disabled researcher, collaborator and artist, coalescing these different backgrounds to bring together where my research is oriented from. Here I am channelling Alice Wong and her many interviews from the <em>Disability Visibility Project</em> (2017), grounding this work in the misfitting and disorientations of being disabled. I do this through a <em>Crip-Tic of Vignettes</em>, playing on the tych scales, from diptych to triptych to other compositions, and Cripping it to a tic (Maier et al., 2020) to hold the contradictory scales, relations and recursive experiences these times unfold through. Instead of a static or linear scaling as norm the Crip-Tic makes room for these vignettes to be positioned inside, beside and beyond each other, whilst also holding the possibility of more and less crip times to be held in relation. The Crip-Tic also aims to hold these crip times not in a primarily analytical form, which could undermine or filter their stories towards a particular point, but instead holds them as Crip times in all their complexity, forming wiggle room in my thesis for them to be held in relation and refracted through later findings.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This assemblage in this research draws out four tics of crip times to orient around and within. Crip times at the academic table, where access is desired but superficial, with little negotiation of or room made for what working with critical access and crip studies entails. Crip times within the computational table, reflecting on the standardised forms and their gaps to fill, the limited choices and obfuscated agencies within computing and the technical systems that we are conformed to by our everyday relations to institutions. Crip times on the operating table, where care as treatment is executed within institutions, and where the medical model invalidates and cures society of the sick through configurations of violence and neglect. After these sections I turn and retreat to crip times at the crip table, the table of disability justice and life affirmation, and one where I have experienced radical sets of crip care and politics in action.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

There are many examples of this within Crip texts, for instance, Margaret Price's <em>Mad at School</em> (2011), but my experiences and tics are contextually specific and form an embodied foundation for this work, the conditions it emerges from and aims to address. I trace the very queer lines of bumping into, running away from, and figuring out what feel like more cozy boundaries in relation to academic institutions. If I return to Ahmed's brief reflection on repetitive strain injury (RSI), how do these paths, these desks and inherited orientations of work determine us to be broken before we even start? In exploring these examples, I aim to open up how academic practices and imaginaries of futures do not imagine us there before we even begin, and in response we need to make lots of Crip trouble so that we can wiggle ourselves in.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Accessibility in institutional terms can prevent disabled researchers from being present at the table. For example, at a major science and technology studies conference in 2024, accessibility was reframed, in practice, to mean early career researchers but not disabled people or other intersections of marginalised international communities either. This was enacted through the logic of cutting costs on hybrid access to fund early career researchers. In cutting the hybrid accessibility to the event, disabled people who find it hard to access in person could not easily be in dialogue, but also those with limited access due to geopolitics and border regimes could not be present either. This left some panels with a fraction of their speakers, falling short of being accessible to these broader intersections of un-imagined communities. The conference also had an inclusive set of food tokens for the event, but with my dietaries I could not make use of most of them so ended up paying for my own food on top as well. These everyday examples of inaccessibility in academic spaces and institutional norm build up to larger, sometimes exhausting, patterns that make these spaces unlivable for many.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From here, I want to attend in more depth to how academic institutions reproduce what Kafer describes as Crip-less futures. Specifically, I am going to discuss a project in which I wanted to imagine with Crip bodies what a future might be. In this experience I realised that academic institutions often can't feel this Crip stuff in their framings of accessibility, as they keep it at the edge of their reach, with no capacity of being intimate. I was told many times what accessibility is by able bodied people in these institutes, prescribed roles I must follow and spaces and times I must fit to, often with my frictions, labours and issues being hidden from view or easily packaged and moved. In this reflection I share where and how I have taken care of my bodymind and this Crip stuff, in order to speak up to and reorient the institution's deterministic ableist configurations of futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I applied for a residency with a major research facility, let's call them X - Digital Future Institute (or X-DFI). In placing the X here I retain partial anonymity, but also refer to SoLiXG's definition of XG<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-2eff08bc2ef3c50a"><a data-footref="g1" href="#fn-1-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, denoting the infinite growth of digital institutions, infrstructures, and imaginaries. In SoLiXG's case this is the power of big tech network and cloud "solutions", and in mine the ever-prevailing ableist institutes of digital futures that will never imagine or be able to hold Crips in their "infinite" futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I originally applied to this residency with the concept of making a crip infrastructure in the form of a server accompanied by a relaxation space. I explained clearly in my application that it was an infrastructure made by and for disabled people that also included a chill space for disabled people to decompress and relax. I expressed clearly my desire that the online space and IRL installation were for crips to have a safe and calm space to collectively imagine what crip futures and practices online might look like. They accepted the project, I was relieved as I could get paid to do some of my own work, and relax about financial stresses. In the first meeting they told me they were chose me because they liked that it was Crip stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was appointed a "mentor" who I met up with briefly. We began to chat about the project and work, I discussed for minimum five minutes ideas of creating infrastructures through non-prescriptive methods. He told me he was the method man, he loved methods and it would be great if I could generalise these methods. I didn't feel heard. I carried on talking about network infrastructures, about alternative imaginaries of care around their limits, from a Crip interdependent approach. He said he didn't understand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the meetings following, the mentor repeatedly questioned the validity of the project and my ability and capacity to make it, instead of caring for its growth. He asked whether a relaxation space was a valid artwork. I tell him there have been many works, by crip artists and others, such as Carmen Papalia's <em>Pain Pals</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-2eff08bc2ef3c50a"><a data-footref="g2" href="#fn-2-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, Navild Acosta and Sosa's <em>Black Power Naps</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-2eff08bc2ef3c50a"><a data-footref="g3" href="#fn-3-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup> and M.E.L.T.'s <em>Rest Assured</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-2eff08bc2ef3c50a"><a data-footref="g4" href="#fn-4-2eff08bc2ef3c50a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a></sup> that orient this approach. Each of them talk about different groups needing space to stop from the incessant efficiencies of late capitalism, to sit in and make their own times and to feel safe. It still didn't seem to be valid to him. He again questioned my capacity to make the digital infrastructure, whether I was able to do what I knew I could do (and had done before). Over email, they asked for quantities: , how long the work would be up, how much community I expected? Repeatedly I had to explain what it was, how I was going to make it. Every time, he exclaimed he didn't understand the theory or the practice, and asked for validity again. There was no trust or affirmation of this Crip infrastructure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Initially my "mentor" told me verbally that the fee was just for me as payment, and they would cover materials and expenses. I was already putting more work into this infrastructure than the fee entailed, as I cared for this stuff. When it came time to get materials, I sent through expenses, and waited. This was during the period where the validity was being doubted (which was realistically the whole time). I had to send through renders to visualise to them what it might be, and costings of materials which took more care and more time. I waited. I emailed to follow up. I waited. The time of the project stood still, Crip infrastructure frozen in-validity. They replied. The cost of the materials now had to come from my fee, unless they were of value and could be used by the X-DFI in the institution's futures. I told them that this was not okay. A while later they offered a small sum, but I still had to pay the majority for the proposed work. This dialogue froze the project for at least a month, as I could not start until I had the small amount of stuff I needed to care for the work. The fee itself then also got frozen so I had to pay out of my pocket to get going. Due to "institutional" delays the payment time had become indefinite, postponed to an unknown date. Due to these delays, I had even less time to care for this stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They delayed the submission a bit, but the damage was already done. I did not really trust, through their actions, that this was a place that could hold Crips, or imagined them being here in this X - Digital Future Institute. There was no flexibility in this hard institute for Crips there. The mentorship could not flex to understand, acknowledge or listen to Crip methods, practices and knowledges, and instead turned me into the problem that needed to be cured. Instead of making space for and affirming these imaginaries, however haphazard they might have seemed, they chose to judge it repeatedly, not finding it valid in their terms. Their terms seemed to infantilize what they thought Crips had capacity for, repeatedly asking me to just make something soft for stimming, easily packaged and handled for when they present it to conferences. They didn't want to handle an awkward Crip body or infrastructure. The change of terms to finances also reduced my trust greatly, as it showed they did not understand or legitimise financial accessibility as a barrier, and that their word was not stable. Due to the payment delays, funding changes and my financial precarity I had to take on another job at the same time, developing an app for another research project. This change of terms, and the eddies that flowed in its trail are additive to the stress and relations that caused my last flare up, and why I ended up back on the operating table I mention in the next section.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After these initial fallouts, I just kept myself to myself and made the infrastructure on the cheap. Though I in many ways had lost faith in this residency, I carried on mainly for the funding and to make my this crip infrastructure "against all odds". So I decided to approah the work as a prototype of what Crip infrastructures might feel like. Using the technical setup I had already knew and developed, but leaving the community out of it whilst the X-DFI voices were still involved. I accompanied this with some cute stickers I rendered and wrote their Alt texts as Crip imaginaries of caring with and for digital network infrastructures. I go on to talk about this infrastructure more in the A Cozier Configure-ability chapter, but in this relation and on top of all the other things I had going on I didn't have the capacity to get them to listen to the nuances of this change or its reasons, so I just didn't communicate it with them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first payment came through as we were getting ready to display, months late. The accessibility of the space had been miscommunicated, stating there was a lift, then there wasn't one, and then there was, which made me anxious about showing there. It turned out it was fine. In preparation for the show, they began quantifying again, asking questions like, what's the maximum time for a person to relax in the space? They didn't seem to feel time slots undermined crip relaxation or politics. They repeatedly tried to put the work in a small single occupancy tipi, to shade disabled people from the light, and maybe hide us away? It also seemed culturally inappropriate to display my work in, as a white British artist.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it came to the time to show the work, even though we had been promised all along that this would be open to the public, and my application explicitly said the work was for the disabled community, they had not listened and it turned out it was just for a private event for the investors of this new building. It was for an event so private that even we the artists were not invited to it. They used this exhibition as the signing off of the works, and again used it to pressure me into buying my own train tickets and paying for my own expenses to set up the work. By this point, I couldn't be bothered to argue against this.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I pitched up to the X-DFI, and was the first one there. I had a nice chat with the receptionist and he offered me a cozy cup of tea. I waited next to a wall of tech company logos. They turned up. We had a tour of the X-DFI, with its brand new facilities in digital twin technology, still half built, with cables and tubes hanging down. It looked expensive, the jewel in the crown of this digital future. I told them it was a dual use technology. They asked what that was. I told them it meant it was made specifically to have both military and commercial uses. They looked surprised. We went upstairs to the open loft space. They had snacks that I couldn't really eat. Luckily, I always bring my own.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I started to set up the work, I chose a nice side with good plugs and ports. I got the server connected fine, and the site was up. I pulled out the soft cushy cloud pillows I had made with a collaborator. They looked surprised I had stuff. I placed the easy read, take home text of the cozy intentions on the table. It was installed, it was a very easy setup.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Soon after though, they came with stuff. Stuff they wanted to stuff in. I hadn't been told about or consented to this stuff. They brought a weighted blanket, which was nice, but was definitely prescribed, and was for the institution and not for the Cozy-Cloud. Play-dough and colouring in bits, that didn't really fit in and seemed to infantilize disabled people. All of this stuff brought and placed in the space without real dialogue or care. They stepped back, and asked again how accessible the space really is, it seems a little technical for "disabled" people and for people from the "street". I told them to access the work you just have to try and relax. They didn't. I asked them who the people categorised and figured to be from the street were? I explained I was creating social access to technical practices and processes which in some places of course will be a little technical, but I am trying to make it as accessible as possible. He asked to edit the cozy intentions of the server. I said no. He asked if he was not woke enough. I said I don't think you have the right lived experience to edit a text by and for disabled people. He eventually left me alone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After they had taken their photo op, where I masked a smile, I left my Crip centred space to be shown to the rich investors of this institute, and we went for dinner. We went to a restaurant where they had tried to make it accessible but it still wasn't great for me. I didn't want to cause trouble again so just went anyway. We ate some dinner, I dared to have one dish and we chatted. My "mentor" complained about how much free work and excessive stuff he had to do to get anywhere in his career and how much he felt he suffered. I thought he should value and care for his time and capacity more. I chatted to other people around the table. When we were finishing up, he got the whole table's attention and said, "I really don't think artists suffer enough to make good work anymore". I stopped. I leaned forward, and I said, "As someone who lives with chronic pain, I really don't think any value should be placed on suffering". He suddenly and eventually went quiet. Later after dinner he sent me a text to apologise, I am not sure if he realised what these sedimented politics also meant for him, or if he had felt "caught out".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I couldn't touch that Crip server for a while after this experience. All of those intentions seemed sullied by this "mentorship" and exclusion from the futures of X institutes. The longer term eddies, the subsequent flare up, operations and appointments this experience and its stresses had contributed to meant that trying to make a crip infrastructure for and by crips for relaxation had in fact manifested itself into more crip pain, stress and struggle when in relation to an X Digital future of these institutions. Now, I am moving to care for these scars and tender, frictious relations, to re-orient the spaces I have capacity in so I can work within them cozily. In softer actions I have pulled out one of the Cozy-Cloud cushions and now sleep with it, dreaming of X-C/CFI (Crip/cozy future infrastructures) most nights. This experience is one that has made me care even more for where I table my Crip stuff. Are academic institutions able to, or do theyeven desire to hold this Crip stuff? Or will their values, politics, relations and orientations always hold it out of reach and disable them from caring for the stuff of Crip futures?</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their <em>Rest Assured</em> workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em> (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T." src="../03_media/Rest Assured.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T." src="thesis/repo/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.png"></span>{#fig:melt}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">M.E.L.T.'s <em>Rest Assured</em> workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as "an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's <em>Artist in president</em> talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em>. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em> event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-3f7654fc126e9399" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-3f7654fc126e9399"><a data-footref="25" href="#fn-1-3f7654fc126e9399" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's <em>Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance</em> workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that "broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure.</p></div><div></div><div>

In many ways this is framed as a retreat in this work, of trying to put the violences of certain tables out of reach, and orient them towards notions, politics and practices of radical crip life affirmation. In this retreat though, and through a Crip understanding of the cyborg, we are still attached to and entangled with them. Through being in relation with these institutional tables of computing, academia and care, I can also shape them in return. It is this refusal to stay in line and to give feedback where it is not wanted. It is when I come to the operating table and finally talking back to the "expertise" of my "specialist", not only to refuse medicine and advice that will harm me, but also asking if he had ever read any disability studies? When he said no, I said, "Don't you think it is interesting you have never listened to the people you care for?" It is when I come to the computing table and the student account interface and feel the normative urge to police them for their attendance, to instead ask myself, "How do I care for this person and to be an ally in their building of capacities?" It is now that I have my own capacity to sit at research tables and send emails telling people what my needs are, and defining good boundaries around them. It is me writing this research and making wiggle room for these reflections and inquiries that maybe give too much information, emotion and anger, but offer within that the capacity to hold these necessary points and times out of line so to disorient and manifest this work from.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this dance I make many mistakes, I am clumsy, I am mad, I am Crip. In this dance I take just a few steps, a couple back, a number sideways. In this dance and between these tables, as I get to grips with them, as they try to shake me off, and as I try to hold on, I build my capacity to reorient them. The shaping effect that some have on me I also have on others, and it is within these frictions, flows, rhythms and moves that this research starts to manifest itself. Again, not through one point but a repetitive Crip-Tic and recursive practice of wiggling room within, between and around the capacities of these hard systems and institutes for our communities and their many tables to be cozily in relation.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></span><br>

There are many examples of this within Crip texts, for instance, Margaret Price's <em>Mad at School</em> (2011), but my experiences and tics are contextually specific and form an embodied foundation for this work, the conditions it emerges from and aims to address. I trace the very queer lines of bumping into, running away from, and figuring out what feel like more cozy boundaries in relation to academic institutions. If I return to Ahmed's brief reflection on repetitive strain injury (RSI), how do these paths, these desks and inherited orientations of work determine us to be broken before we even start? In exploring these examples, I aim to open up how academic practices and imaginaries of futures do not imagine us there before we even begin, and in response we need to make lots of Crip trouble so that we can wiggle ourselves in.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Accessibility in institutional terms can prevent disabled researchers from being present at the table. For example, at a major science and technology studies conference in 2024, accessibility was reframed, in practice, to mean early career researchers but not disabled people or other intersections of marginalised international communities either. This was enacted through the logic of cutting costs on hybrid access to fund early career researchers. In cutting the hybrid accessibility to the event, disabled people who find it hard to access in person could not easily be in dialogue, but also those with limited access due to geopolitics and border regimes could not be present either. This left some panels with a fraction of their speakers, falling short of being accessible to these broader intersections of un-imagined communities. The conference also had an inclusive set of food tokens for the event, but with my dietaries I could not make use of most of them so ended up paying for my own food on top as well. These everyday examples of inaccessibility in academic spaces and institutional norm build up to larger, sometimes exhausting, patterns that make these spaces unlivable for many.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">From here, I want to attend in more depth to how academic institutions reproduce what Kafer describes as Crip-less futures. Specifically, I am going to discuss a project in which I wanted to imagine with Crip bodies what a future might be. In this experience I realised that academic institutions often can't feel this Crip stuff in their framings of accessibility, as they keep it at the edge of their reach, with no capacity of being intimate. I was told many times what accessibility is by able bodied people in these institutes, prescribed roles I must follow and spaces and times I must fit to, often with my frictions, labours and issues being hidden from view or easily packaged and moved. In this reflection I share where and how I have taken care of my bodymind and this Crip stuff, in order to speak up to and reorient the institution's deterministic ableist configurations of futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I applied for a residency with a major research facility, let's call them X - Digital Future Institute (or X-DFI). In placing the X here I retain partial anonymity, but also refer to SoLiXG's definition of XG<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-0d90466cec598f47"><a data-footref="g1" href="#fn-1-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, denoting the infinite growth of digital institutions, infrstructures, and imaginaries. In SoLiXG's case this is the power of big tech network and cloud "solutions", and in mine the ever-prevailing ableist institutes of digital futures that will never imagine or be able to hold Crips in their "infinite" futures.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I originally applied to this residency with the concept of making a crip infrastructure in the form of a server accompanied by a relaxation space. I explained clearly in my application that it was an infrastructure made by and for disabled people that also included a chill space for disabled people to decompress and relax. I expressed clearly my desire that the online space and IRL installation were for crips to have a safe and calm space to collectively imagine what crip futures and practices online might look like. They accepted the project, I was relieved as I could get paid to do some of my own work, and relax about financial stresses. In the first meeting they told me they were chose me because they liked that it was Crip stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I was appointed a "mentor" who I met up with briefly. We began to chat about the project and work, I discussed for minimum five minutes ideas of creating infrastructures through non-prescriptive methods. He told me he was the method man, he loved methods and it would be great if I could generalise these methods. I didn't feel heard. I carried on talking about network infrastructures, about alternative imaginaries of care around their limits, from a Crip interdependent approach. He said he didn't understand.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In the meetings following, the mentor repeatedly questioned the validity of the project and my ability and capacity to make it, instead of caring for its growth. He asked whether a relaxation space was a valid artwork. I tell him there have been many works, by crip artists and others, such as Carmen Papalia's <em>Pain Pals</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-2-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2-0d90466cec598f47"><a data-footref="g2" href="#fn-2-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a></sup>, Navild Acosta and Sosa's <em>Black Power Naps</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-3-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3-0d90466cec598f47"><a data-footref="g3" href="#fn-3-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a></sup> and M.E.L.T.'s <em>Rest Assured</em><sup data-footnote-id="fnref-4-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-4-0d90466cec598f47"><a data-footref="g4" href="#fn-4-0d90466cec598f47" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a></sup> that orient this approach. Each of them talk about different groups needing space to stop from the incessant efficiencies of late capitalism, to sit in and make their own times and to feel safe. It still didn't seem to be valid to him. He again questioned my capacity to make the digital infrastructure, whether I was able to do what I knew I could do (and had done before). Over email, they asked for quantities: , how long the work would be up, how much community I expected? Repeatedly I had to explain what it was, how I was going to make it. Every time, he exclaimed he didn't understand the theory or the practice, and asked for validity again. There was no trust or affirmation of this Crip infrastructure.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Initially my "mentor" told me verbally that the fee was just for me as payment, and they would cover materials and expenses. I was already putting more work into this infrastructure than the fee entailed, as I cared for this stuff. When it came time to get materials, I sent through expenses, and waited. This was during the period where the validity was being doubted (which was realistically the whole time). I had to send through renders to visualise to them what it might be, and costings of materials which took more care and more time. I waited. I emailed to follow up. I waited. The time of the project stood still, Crip infrastructure frozen in-validity. They replied. The cost of the materials now had to come from my fee, unless they were of value and could be used by the X-DFI in the institution's futures. I told them that this was not okay. A while later they offered a small sum, but I still had to pay the majority for the proposed work. This dialogue froze the project for at least a month, as I could not start until I had the small amount of stuff I needed to care for the work. The fee itself then also got frozen so I had to pay out of my pocket to get going. Due to "institutional" delays the payment time had become indefinite, postponed to an unknown date. Due to these delays, I had even less time to care for this stuff.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">They delayed the submission a bit, but the damage was already done. I did not really trust, through their actions, that this was a place that could hold Crips, or imagined them being here in this X - Digital Future Institute. There was no flexibility in this hard institute for Crips there. The mentorship could not flex to understand, acknowledge or listen to Crip methods, practices and knowledges, and instead turned me into the problem that needed to be cured. Instead of making space for and affirming these imaginaries, however haphazard they might have seemed, they chose to judge it repeatedly, not finding it valid in their terms. Their terms seemed to infantilize what they thought Crips had capacity for, repeatedly asking me to just make something soft for stimming, easily packaged and handled for when they present it to conferences. They didn't want to handle an awkward Crip body or infrastructure. The change of terms to finances also reduced my trust greatly, as it showed they did not understand or legitimise financial accessibility as a barrier, and that their word was not stable. Due to the payment delays, funding changes and my financial precarity I had to take on another job at the same time, developing an app for another research project. This change of terms, and the eddies that flowed in its trail are additive to the stress and relations that caused my last flare up, and why I ended up back on the operating table I mention in the next section.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After these initial fallouts, I just kept myself to myself and made the infrastructure on the cheap. Though I in many ways had lost faith in this residency, I carried on mainly for the funding and to make my this crip infrastructure "against all odds". So I decided to approah the work as a prototype of what Crip infrastructures might feel like. Using the technical setup I had already knew and developed, but leaving the community out of it whilst the X-DFI voices were still involved. I accompanied this with some cute stickers I rendered and wrote their Alt texts as Crip imaginaries of caring with and for digital network infrastructures. I go on to talk about this infrastructure more in the A Cozier Configure-ability chapter, but in this relation and on top of all the other things I had going on I didn't have the capacity to get them to listen to the nuances of this change or its reasons, so I just didn't communicate it with them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first payment came through as we were getting ready to display, months late. The accessibility of the space had been miscommunicated, stating there was a lift, then there wasn't one, and then there was, which made me anxious about showing there. It turned out it was fine. In preparation for the show, they began quantifying again, asking questions like, what's the maximum time for a person to relax in the space? They didn't seem to feel time slots undermined crip relaxation or politics. They repeatedly tried to put the work in a small single occupancy tipi, to shade disabled people from the light, and maybe hide us away? It also seemed culturally inappropriate to display my work in, as a white British artist.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it came to the time to show the work, even though we had been promised all along that this would be open to the public, and my application explicitly said the work was for the disabled community, they had not listened and it turned out it was just for a private event for the investors of this new building. It was for an event so private that even we the artists were not invited to it. They used this exhibition as the signing off of the works, and again used it to pressure me into buying my own train tickets and paying for my own expenses to set up the work. By this point, I couldn't be bothered to argue against this.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I pitched up to the X-DFI, and was the first one there. I had a nice chat with the receptionist and he offered me a cozy cup of tea. I waited next to a wall of tech company logos. They turned up. We had a tour of the X-DFI, with its brand new facilities in digital twin technology, still half built, with cables and tubes hanging down. It looked expensive, the jewel in the crown of this digital future. I told them it was a dual use technology. They asked what that was. I told them it meant it was made specifically to have both military and commercial uses. They looked surprised. We went upstairs to the open loft space. They had snacks that I couldn't really eat. Luckily, I always bring my own.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I started to set up the work, I chose a nice side with good plugs and ports. I got the server connected fine, and the site was up. I pulled out the soft cushy cloud pillows I had made with a collaborator. They looked surprised I had stuff. I placed the easy read, take home text of the cozy intentions on the table. It was installed, it was a very easy setup.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Soon after though, they came with stuff. Stuff they wanted to stuff in. I hadn't been told about or consented to this stuff. They brought a weighted blanket, which was nice, but was definitely prescribed, and was for the institution and not for the Cozy-Cloud. Play-dough and colouring in bits, that didn't really fit in and seemed to infantilize disabled people. All of this stuff brought and placed in the space without real dialogue or care. They stepped back, and asked again how accessible the space really is, it seems a little technical for "disabled" people and for people from the "street". I told them to access the work you just have to try and relax. They didn't. I asked them who the people categorised and figured to be from the street were? I explained I was creating social access to technical practices and processes which in some places of course will be a little technical, but I am trying to make it as accessible as possible. He asked to edit the cozy intentions of the server. I said no. He asked if he was not woke enough. I said I don't think you have the right lived experience to edit a text by and for disabled people. He eventually left me alone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After they had taken their photo op, where I masked a smile, I left my Crip centred space to be shown to the rich investors of this institute, and we went for dinner. We went to a restaurant where they had tried to make it accessible but it still wasn't great for me. I didn't want to cause trouble again so just went anyway. We ate some dinner, I dared to have one dish and we chatted. My "mentor" complained about how much free work and excessive stuff he had to do to get anywhere in his career and how much he felt he suffered. I thought he should value and care for his time and capacity more. I chatted to other people around the table. When we were finishing up, he got the whole table's attention and said, "I really don't think artists suffer enough to make good work anymore". I stopped. I leaned forward, and I said, "As someone who lives with chronic pain, I really don't think any value should be placed on suffering". He suddenly and eventually went quiet. Later after dinner he sent me a text to apologise, I am not sure if he realised what these sedimented politics also meant for him, or if he had felt "caught out".</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I couldn't touch that Crip server for a while after this experience. All of those intentions seemed sullied by this "mentorship" and exclusion from the futures of X institutes. The longer term eddies, the subsequent flare up, operations and appointments this experience and its stresses had contributed to meant that trying to make a crip infrastructure for and by crips for relaxation had in fact manifested itself into more crip pain, stress and struggle when in relation to an X Digital future of these institutions. Now, I am moving to care for these scars and tender, frictious relations, to re-orient the spaces I have capacity in so I can work within them cozily. In softer actions I have pulled out one of the Cozy-Cloud cushions and now sleep with it, dreaming of X-C/CFI (Crip/cozy future infrastructures) most nights. This experience is one that has made me care even more for where I table my Crip stuff. Are academic institutions able to, or do theyeven desire to hold this Crip stuff? Or will their values, politics, relations and orientations always hold it out of reach and disable them from caring for the stuff of Crip futures?</p></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>

I am approaching this through two avenues here, though there are many other approaches I could take. The first is to reflect on how I as an individual have systemically by multiple institutions been placed and prescribed to specific cells within tables by others as they translate my experience into evidence to validate my care. Here I am thinking this through with Mia Mingus' <em>Forced Intimacy</em> (2017). I will also reflect on how I as a teacher and carer for students have found the computational interface of access, and the social relations of students' access needs often hidden or held out of reach, making it harder to care for their access out of the norms of these institutions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The first step is opening the tab on how I have been categorised, documented and (in)validated by both academic and care institutes. Within both there has always been a separation between me and my embodied knowing of my experience, and the computational cells that it is put into. This separation is carried out by the "expert" or the "specialist" who "knows" what I am experiencing better than I do, and who will translate and filter it into the abstract syntax and figures that are valid within these political systems and institutional relations. All of these orientations take what has happened to me, how I feel about it and the sense I make from it, and de-legitimise and invalidate them, to instead be stated in the abstract words and figures they have sedimented out of reach of me. It is also with the understated and normalised violence through which these invalidating logics are instrumentalised. This has manifested for me as 9 years of my specialist and carers denying my chronic pain, as "studies and figures show that part of my body doesn't have pain receptors". This is until recently, when another cell has been ticked even further out of my reach, and certain medications for chronic pain have been legalised, and so seemingly has my pain. It is also that another "expert" regulating my workplace stress and need for access, and who was mediating the input into its validating ex-cell table, was a manager who was additive to my workplace stress. When I asked (as I had a number of times before) if he could invite me to the relevant staff meetings for me, as I was part time, his reasonable adjustment was instead to tell me to come to every third one. In reflection this left me more anxious as I still wasn't sure which to go to, or if I would get in the way. I also reflected to myself here how meeting invites are a fairly standard practice, and the computed table of the calendar event had space for this invitation, but instead he just refused to action this.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here, I approach the computing table through Mia Mingus' <em>Forced Intimacy</em> (2017). For her, this concept covers the many ways that people with disabilities in need of direct physical care, can be forced into intimate contact with those around them, who can often be strangers. She also widens this scope to think similarly about how disabled people often have to give up intimate information about ourselves to validate our access needs, and yet often still don't have them met in return. Little care is given to these relations within computing tables. When working through getting my access needs recognised, and reasonable adjustments made for my teaching role at my university, I had to go through an assessment with an external equality diversity inclusion (EDI) company for them to be validated. It being an externalised and outsourced company was no surprise in the neo-liberal configuration of institutions, but it did make me reflect on how desperate these bodies are not to have disabled people within them. So much so that they have others take care of us for them, others who can take the blame when things go wrong, others who they can keep us from being intimate with, and to stop us from being intimate with them, and others that they can easily cut off when they do not have to follow EDI any more. In this meeting, I spent 40 minutes with a person I had never met before, and have never since. After I had validated my illness through telling them among many such intimate things, including that I didn't drink as it made me sick, they finished the meeting by tell me to "not take advantage of this access" and for instance "go out drinking, and call in sick the next day". I was astonished by the lack of care and intimacy,, to not even pick up on this basic thing. I firmly reminded them I didn't drink as it made me sick, and also used this place of reaffirming dialogue to remind them that I was very sick, and their report had real implications on my life, so please make it out as it is. She seemed to listen, and the report was very firm and clear.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The fact is, often this intimate data is compiled only to lead to inaction, producing what Ruha Benjamin calls the "datafication of injustice" (2020, p.&nbsp;117). This is evident when I reflect on the way the institutions of care have computed me on their tables, and held me in their cells. When being tabled in their systems, experts directed how I was. This included GPs over the phone telling me they didn't think my flare up and chronic pain was that urgent, so putting me on a longer waiting list, saying if they changed anything I would still be waiting just as long. This was until I spoke up, a cell was ticked and I was seen in weeks. It also meant that I have to catch a bus or train for 1 hour each way to get my bloods done, as my "specialist" doesn't want to do the "homework" that means the box will tick so I can get them done by my local GP. Relevant information about my bodily experience and care becomes lost in translation somehow. For example, I repeatedly told medical practitioners about my bodily sensitivities and needs at three points before I was operated on, yet at every point this was not accounted for or recorded. When I asked my specialist at the time about this, after the horrific fallout from this lack of intimacy, which I go onto more in the operating table, he shrugged and said, "of course". When I went back again after having passed out from a flashback, told multiple people in A&amp;E I thought I had PTSD from my operation, none of them cared or recorded it. When I next saw my specialist again, he didn't know. In these experiences, I felt this sense that the only thing that was being recorded about me was their observations of me, specifically ones through mechanisms that gave "exact figures". How fast was my heartbeat, what was my body mass index, what was the molecular composition of my shit. My specialist summed up their ideology:, "You understand, as a coder, right? We need more data! Until then, we can't know what is wrong with you". In response to this I wanted to explain how data is often an undermining factor of what is evidence and who can make it, meaning myy needs were eternally delayed or badly treated, as my embodied data and knowledge was not valid. I was exhausted and coming to from being operated on violently so I couldn't quite make this out to him, nor would he have been intimate with those words. It is also part of this longer history, one where my documents, figures and ex-cell tables from my last hospital had not been transferred over, probably due to the repeated neglect I had experienced there, but also maybe their desire to have this evidence of neglect lost. Either way, this also contributed to me being placed violently on the operating table without the care and intimacy I needed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I re-orient towards the computing table as someone who has to navigate and access it as a teacher and carer within the academic institution it helps to highlight how some of these dynamics come into relation. To do this I will critique the web interface for the teacher side of a student account, orienting the access of their access needs through computed tables. The interface for the website as a whole is very clunky and complex with many windows, tabs and sub menus to get lost in. I have never been trained in this interface properly, nor has anyone I know.. S4 is an appropriated commerce software that is similar to ones I have encountered when working in retail jobs. No one had shown me where the access needs of students were stored, even after I had done the course on EDI. I asked my manager where they were so I could read up on some of my students' needs. He didn't reply for a while and some of the needs were somewhat urgent, so I asked again. He replied saying that their access needs are confidential, so he couldn't email them to me, but that they were in the interface somewhere, without giving me direction. I eventually bumped into him in the office later that week, and managed to get him to show me where they were. The student access notes, as he showed me, were in a back tab of their student page. The tab was called "Related" and the area the essential access information was under was named "Provisions". None of this read "access" to me, and all of it felt like a barrier. The information held here also felt like it was quite static, and like it might be as equally hard for a student to access and update their needs dynamically as it was for me to find them, potentially leaving this information outdated. When I also tried to link technician who were also responsible for these students through to this access information on S4, they told me that they did not have the permissions to access this information, so I would have to share it with them manually for them to know. All of these social and technical orientations place access and the information someone gives about their own desires and needs around institutional care at the far end of the table and well out of reach, especially out of touch of the possibilities of intimacy and care for their access needs.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When I return to S4 to see what it does emphasise in place of access, it is endless figures and values that regulate the student's progress, mainly orienting attendance. As visualised below (+@fig:360), from the university S4 basic PDF guide, there is no space in this 360° student account to hold their access or needs. Instead, when we examine their page there are constant figures on the right, no matter what tab you are on, showing student attendance in both doughnut and line graphs. Even when you are reading their access needs you are still prompted by these figures, and how much a student has been present or not. This is not the only place, as 95% of the interface on their profile and the information around them is also different aspects of their attendance record, but all through filtered gates presented by the teacher, expert and policy maker. This ranged from check in codes that are easily shared to show presence, marks from projects, and approval/denial of applications for things like extenuating circumstances. Again like my own experiences of being computationally tabled in care institutes, these are abstracted figures, taken by others, or configured through datafied logics, denying students' capacities to figure themselves out in relation to their own education and institutional care.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="S4 student account visualisation." src="../03_media/S4_360.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="S4 student account visualisation." src="thesis/repo/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.png"></span>{#fig:360}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I share these frictions to offer up how these computed and automated tables filter and put out of reach people with disabilities, their access knowledges and their agency. It is, as I will go on to say more in the Configure-able Methods chapter, not so much that these tables cannot hold access, but that the experts, specialists and politics that hold these relations in place keep access knowledges, disabilities frictions and their radical criptiques out of reach. Access could be displayed on the student account where the other figures of attendance are, permanent, unavoidable and central to our relation and dialogue with them, but instead it is squeezed frictiously and misfitting into a pre-figured slot in a back tab of a sales software. In my own experiences of being operated on and treated through the computational tables a care institute, there was similarly no clear and effective way for me to communicate my access needs within these ex-cells, as this was configured as "homework" by an expect, instead of central to my care and affirmation. This research orients away from this configuration of computed ex-cells that hold, invalidate and hide disability, to instead move towards social and technical practice and relations for these systems that can affirm lives and centre these crip capacities for radical access and care around computing tables.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">03.02_The_computing_table</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-custom" style="z-index: 5; transform: translate(44px, 1283px); width: 740px; height: 523px; --canvas-node-width: 740px; --canvas-node-height: 523px; --canvas-color: 33,159,222;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The operating table" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_operating_table"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The operating table</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-div"><div data-callout-metadata="" data-callout-fold="" data-callout="note" class="callout"><div class="callout-title" dir="auto"><div class="callout-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-pencil"><path d="M21.174 6.812a1 1 0 0 0-3.986-3.987L3.842 16.174a2 2 0 0 0-.5.83l-1.321 4.352a.5.5 0 0 0 .623.622l4.353-1.32a2 2 0 0 0 .83-.497z"></path><path d="m15 5 4 4"></path></svg></div><div class="callout-title-inner">Trigger warnings of operations and medical pain etc. Skip to The Crip table if you want to avoid potential triggers.</div></div></div></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this section, I will reflect on how the efficiencies of care institutes and health systems leave Crip people on edge waiting for minimal care at any unknown (or unknowable) point. Specifically in my context of the UK National Health Service (NHS), as well as other benefit and care systems that have been heavily underfunded through "austerity" politics we can turn to the work of China Mills (2018; Mills &amp; Pring, 2024) to see how the health system has a direct effect on the mental wellbeing and possibility of disabled life under these violent times, policies and politics. Here I will bring into focus my own embodied experiences of these relations, and how they made sense to me as a crip researcher.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here, I could talk for ages about the subtleties and changes in how my injected medicine is scheduled for delivery around the hard efficiencies of the system and not my capacities. Similarly I could turn to how Laura Forlano rubs up against and hacks her medical devices and relations (2023; 2016). I could discuss how I am a cyborg modified with biologics, and connected to a refrigerated delivery pipeline. How this has slowly changed without my input from a relation where the default was a call from a caring person, who would help to guide and talk through the process of arranging your delivery through to the current efficient appified model, that pings, pokes and "reminds" you to go through some fiddly forms, which you may not be in a good place to respond to. These sets of relations are complex and situated though, and some people may find this sort of automation frees them up to have more agency over their care, whereas others may find this system cannot care for their needs as it is too generalised.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">What I want to rub up against here is the neo-liberal catchy rhetoric around ethical automation. I heard the likes of "a human in the system" at a UKRI <em>social science conferences</em>, and which through a few words aims to cure the inabilities of automated systems to care. The irony is that there is always "a person" within a system if not many, some trying to approach it, some developing and orienting it, as well as the many maintaining it, but all of these positions and more seem to be ignored. By their definition they aim to cure the inabilities of the system by throwing another person in the middle, and this generalised five word slogan cannot specify where they are or what they are doing. You could throw in 100 more people, but if we do not care about how, where or what stuff they are doing, we could be doing them and the people, things and relations they are trying to "care for" as much damage as if they were not there. This next section gives a more precise encounter of automation without affirmation that I experienced in my chronic care. The lack of intimacy in this encounter highlights why the work of imagining and orienting towards affirmative infrastructure is so essential.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this section I will recount a recent experience of institutionalised "care" that left me with more violent damage to my body than it benefited my well-being. This began when I had my third major flare up of my life. This resulted mainly from being a crip person forced to work over full-time to financially survive when I only have the ability to work part-time. This relational fallout was due to unstable terms, non-existent support networks, both institutional and familial, and the invalidating exhaustive expectations of normative social roles. I have already touched on these causalities and eddies in earlier sections, so here I will orienting more around how in the aftermath of these relations, and when in search of care, it became a struggle to have my needs acknowledge let alone cared for. This reflection is also not meant as a individual tale of a singular crip's treatment, but a place to expand and fabulate from, especially in the UK. It is where I make room and time for us to imagine the industrial scales that the political/relations of institutional care tables operate through.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When trying to reach out for help it first has to be noted that I was in the cracks of a system. I was between hospitals, not only due to having moved locations, but also due to me running away from similar mistreatment in my prior specialist department. This left me between pipelines of care and treading water to stay afloat as I flared up with no support beyond taking sick leave and time off of one of my four jobs I had at that time. When reaching out for a referral to my local hospital in Plymouth, both my GP and my previous carers both pointed the finger at each other to initiate this change. After a while I pushed the GP to initiate this move as I did want to get in touch or engage with my old department. They put me through as a standard referral, even though I was badly flared. After a month or two of "self care" I finally received a referral letter with no date on it, but telling me to check my contact details, ready for when they would contact me and a date would be given. I decided this was not good enough and pushed the GP to increase my urgency on the referral. In response he said that this was unlikely to do anything and tried to convince me not to do it. In response to this I told him that I was very much living in a reality where these things felt unlikely to change and I just needed him to try and see what would happen. After this strong defending of my needs he agreed to raise the importance of the referral. "Against all the odds" this resulted in me getting a call to book in an appointment one week later with my new specialist. In the virtual call with this specialist, he very calmly tried to quell my anxieties by offering me multiple examinations, from a low intrusive MRI, through to an intrusive colonoscopy, both to find out what the "problem" is. At the time this did comfort me somewhat but it became obvious that these were just words and none of the care would be non-intrusive.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After this meeting I waited a few weeks, and eventually a letter came through the post of another non-dated referral for a colonoscopy. This time though it came with an enema kit, labelled, "cleen, ready-to-use" (+@fig:cleen). When I opened it up, I wondered how long, if ever, it would take for me to be given an appointment. The only thing I knew was that when the call came I had to empty my bowls ready for them to violate my body to acquire the data that would validate my pain, and the needs that I had already informed them of verbally.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Cleen and ready-to-use enema kit." src="../03_media/Cleen.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Cleen and ready-to-use enema kit." src="thesis/repo/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/cleen.png"></span>{#fig:cleen}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">A few weeks later, somewhat fortunately, and somewhat stressfully, I received another letter and call from the appointments team informing me that I had been given a slot in just under two weeks' time. Time shifted from an eternity into immediacy, taking me off balance as I was not prepared to experience the same treatment that had left me traumatised years before. The department's preparation for this appointment was again a virtual telephone appointment with a nurse to do the pre-assessment. In this call I tried to vouch for the type of care that I wanted, asking to be sedated as I knew this was a painful experience for me, and expressing that I had been previous difficulties with this procedure. In response the nurse only played down my fears and told me that it would not be as bad as I thought, and encouraged me not to be sedated for the procedure, and just to take gas and air to alleviate minor pain. I still tried to vouch for myself but ended up in a middle ground of trying gas and air, to then turn to sedation if I felt it was too much during the procedure. The thing I find extraordinary, beyond the playing down of my fears, is that when I expressed previous traumatic experiences in this area, they did not think to provide extra care for this, in the forms of providing sedation, nor mental health support going into it. They also did not ask for more information around what happened and how to care for it. Fortunately, I have the capacity to afford a private therapist that I have been seeing for a while and they squeezed me in last minute, and coached me through the upcoming treatment. It would have been very hard without this extra time and care. These extra times though were too much for the institutions of care to afford, and realistically had always been since the start of my disability 7 years prior. This denial of more time to care when we table sensitive bodies and relations in time is a denial and invalidation of the affirmative types of care that these institutions and their efficient capital configurations could hold if configured otherwise.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">When it came to the day of the procedure, I was lucky enough to have a support network that meant that it was possible for me to be sedated if I needed to be. If I was isolated, like many disabled people are, and without this support system of people to look after me for twenty four hours after the procedure, I would have had to forfeit sedation, as again the institution would not have the time to hold me. As I went in with my friend, we were early to be checked in, so hanging around awkwardly in the corridors of the hospital. When we finally went in to register me, I went to the desk of the department, where I was greeted by, as I guessed by their voice and demeanour, the nurse with whom I had had the phone pre-assessment. Again this interaction seemed to play down my fears and experiences, and pushed me to be squeezed and misfitted into the efficient configures slot of their normative care of gas and air and not be sedated as I had repeatedly asked. After this I waited with my friend, and after 30 minutes I was ushered into another pre-assessment room, where I was quantified, by weight, height and blood pressure, and then left to wait again but by myself.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">After sitting there for what felt like an eternity, with many thoughts running through my mind, and anxieties growing, I started to question and think about how to again try and advocate for the type of care that would affirm me here. I took small steps to test the waters and capacitiy for wiggle room within what felt like a very hard system. Initially I started by just asking to go to the toilet, which I had not been told where or if I could use. After this small success I had started to build up the momentum to feel like I was able to vouch for the type of care that I really needed. I was eventually taken through to the operating table, where I was briefly introduced to the two men operating on me who I had never met before, nor had a virtual call with. They went on to lay me down and prepare me for the operation, it's hard to remember but it initially felt like my desires to be sedated had not made it through. It was only when I stated the word "traumatising" in relation to my prior experiences that his eyes lit up, and he started to take me seriously. It is hard to say here whether that was in relation to providing me with the appropriate care for my situation, or whether it was that by stating these words I had gained leverage by holding him accountable to his actions.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I still for some reason felt obliged to try and be shoehorned into the efficient slot of non-sedation, and have the sedation as a backup, something I will not do again. To prepare for this he went to put an IV in my left arm. After having my blood taken many times, every three months for the last 7 years, I am used to the pain and know what to expect, and also get complimented on how easy my veins are to find. As he slipped in, I felt more pain than normal, a sharp sting that I flinched at; as he tried to draw blood it worsened and so did my reaction. Disregarding my response and feelings and after a few more painful attempts to get it to flow he pulled out, telling me that I had not stayed in-line with his needle. I began to cry, feeling no trust in this person, or in how they were about to operate on me. I lay there still. Without a glance he moved to the other arm, and proceeded to try again. This time I was internally trying to stay in-line as much as possible as he slid inside of me. This time it felt the same as any other, and this time I did not flinch.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is also the time that I passed out, not that time at that table, but the time just after writing the last paragraph at this table. Twenty four hours later, writing this having again been treated by the NHS, this time for passing out, for falling from a counter chair, and for hitting my head on the ground. All because I dare to remember that time. I think it's safe to say that I will not be writing about that time, but I can tell you worlds collapsed, sedation through party drugs doubled by bodily violation and immense pain brought memories, spaces and feelings in-line and out of time. I blacked out from pain and I awoke still crying.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Waking up on the floor after passing out remembering this, this time. I was assisted by the staff of the coffee shop. They helped me sit up, drink up and come to. They did, however, immediately get me to sign an accident waiver form to make sure that they would be covered around this individual "problem". They asked why it happened, I could not say. I texted my friend, and she said she was on her way. When I was doing better I gently walked home, around the corner, where she met me. I felt obliged by norms of rational care to call up 111, the low emergency support number in the UK. I felt okay, and had no clear signs of concussion, but the rationale of their care insisted I go back to the hospital, the same hospital I had remembered. They told me it was urgent, so I should pay for a taxi, but not important enough to send an ambulance, but they would be waiting and ready to receive me. I went in again, they did not know who I was and were not ready for me, sitting there like human livestock, watching people go mad around me in these sick times. I was quantified, I had my vitals taken after a few hours, but nothing said to me, just that it wouldn't be so bad. I waited another few hours with nothing said to me. I finally asked what was going on, they told me I had another 3-4 hours left to be seen. A senior doctor, not in the conversation and with his back to me looked over his shoulder said, "you should probably go home". I asked, "do you know why I am here?" He did not, even though I had told four people why I had passed out, because I had remembered. Their table of operations could not hold this information. They told me "that I had decided to come here", and so "it was on me". I told them "111 had told me to be there", so I felt like I had to go here, if it was up to me, I would have stayed home from the beginning. They didn't reply, I took a complaints number and left. I still haven't complained because I am not sure what it will do.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As I woke up after the last time, crying, in came the "specialist" who had done this to me. He told me how my body was, he told me that I was having fast movements, when they were actually very slow, and told me to take medicine to slow me down further. I refused. He told me that I wasn't so inflamed, I told him it had been months since I was, so was starting to settle after my own care. He told me that when you focus on sensing something too much it can start to hurt more than if you ignore it. I had just stopped heavily dissociating from my body that year, and focusing on my body and feelings was helping me to get stable. He tried to get me to take more biological and immunosuppressant medicines as a quick fix. I refused and vouched for the type of care that I wanted: mental, dietary and financial. He looked confused. He then started to prescribe me dietary advice whilst I was still reeling in pain and confusion from this experience, not in a way where it was helpful, but in a way where he reinforced his expertise and role as a "specialist". He left, my friend picked me up, with another giving me a lift home.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">On my own Crip timeline of writing this thesis, it took me a month just to start writing again since being on the operating table, as I could not find the words. No one in those institutions and from that time called me up for aftercare. My bodymind was much worse off after being treated by them and it has taken many more than months to heal it still. These treatments, these performances of efficient industrial care and this experience have still not benefited me in any way so far, just left more scars on my bodymind. I again stepped out from this public institution and into private care, in the form of paying for myself to have a dietitian and try to improve things. This time, I think because I had paid for it, I had someone's time and this time they listened and cared. Over this time, I started to get better again.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The "specialist" who had done this to me, had, however listened somewhat and gotten me a dietitian from the NHS. This appointment was more disorienting than helpful though. Even though I had been making progress, been gaining weight, been feeling better in my body, they told me that I should stop what I was doing and have a normal diet. That I should just be normal, otherwise I might be doing damage to my own bodymind, and that the feelings and practices I had grown in relation to my expertise where not okay. They didn't give me any advice on how to become "normal", just that I should be, and that I should also start eating things that I knew were painful to eat. They also told me I should get on more medication as a quick fix, even though I am not sure they were qualified to recommend this. Quite inappropriately they were also the one to tell me the results that came back from my operation, and that I was still inflamed, even though he had told me I wasn't when I awoke. This was over a month later and no one had reached out to tell me this before. They also told me I had a different condition to what I had been diagnosed with before. I left disenfranchised, disoriented and dissociating.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I later had another appointment with my "specialist" as a follow up a month or two later than the dietitian. I arrived on time, the appointment was delayed. I waited an hour and a half. He finally made time for me. I went in, and he was already high energy, it was hard for me to orient around this anxious energy. I asked if I could record the meeting to listen back and chat about it with my sister. He said no and started saying I was trying to post him online, and set him up, I was not trying to do this. We ended up getting a nurse to help mediate the conversation. It carried on with this type of dynamic for the entire appointment, with him taking an hour to even "remember", acknowledge, and validate what happened in my last operation by him. Continually after this point he tried to make me feel bad for taking more time than my appointment allocated, of needing too much, and trying to shake me off this table. When we finally got past him acknowledging the operation happened we finally turned to future care for me, where he still told me I had a different condition to what I had been told all along. I contested this, but he said he knew, even though he did not have the files from my old hospital, as they had not been transferred. In a later meeting with my specialist nurse, which was actually the first close to affirmative appointment I had, she finally acknowledged that I had the condition I knew I had, and proven through the data my "specialist" had misread. She also noted that some of the medication that he had suggested would not have helped, was inappropriate and may have made things worse. The thing I found profound, and which is a sedimented critique of the medical model and pharma-capitol is his normalised move to prescribe very expensive, high side effect, and restraining medication, rather than provide social relational care for me. Instead of listening from the beginning where I asked for a dietitian, a therapist and some space to reorient my bodymind and which cost roughly the same if not less that the medication he wanted to prescribe, this "data" was invalidated, to instead go on a deep and violent exploration to the truth of the problem, which I already knew . . . was in the system.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I don't recount this as a sympathy plea, as to say that I am the one suffering, or to recourse revenge on the problematic people in these systems, but to make room on this table for this stuff. Compared to other disabled people under the current economic system, I am a relatively financially stable person, and if you know me you know I am also very able and willing to defend my boundaries. I am also white and often perceived as a man by these institutions, which is frustrating, but all these things will orient the type of care I receive. This is one incident in my own life, and sits here as a frictious contour, a misfitting of needs, and a cliff to look over the bodily horizon of these institutions of care. It is to to make room to bring in the background of disability the norms of the institutions invalidate and ignore. Not as a matter of fact, but a fact that matters, and matters more when we fabulate to hold the many stories of people within this industrial grinding down of care. Ones which are much worse than this. Sitting in the A&amp;E for 5 hours was enough to see these lives, these times, and these bodyminds being driven mad and made sick in the presence of institutional care. This institution is not meant to hold all of these lives, experiences and pain, as it was never imagined to. This recollection of the operating table is here to wedge open the door from slamming shut and let these feelings spill through into dialogues of affirmative infrastructures. How can these Crip experiences, practices and wisdoms around institutions, around just refusal and self-advocacy, be in relation to those that wish to operate on us? How can they inform critiques of the current configurations of care and imagine the times, spaces and futures we really need? When I say really need, I mean really need.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">03.03_The_operating_table</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-1" style="z-index: 6; transform: translate(44px, 2080px); width: 740px; height: 600px; --canvas-node-width: 740px; --canvas-node-height: 600px;"><div class="canvas-node-container"><div class="canvas-node-content markdown-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event"><div class="markdown-preview-view markdown-rendered"><div class="markdown-preview-sizer markdown-preview-section"><div class="mod-header mod-ui"></div><div class="el-h2 heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="The crip table" dir="auto" class="heading" id="The_crip_table"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>The crip table</h2><div class="heading-children"><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Here is in many ways where I start to turn away from these other tables I have been institutionally forced to be in touch with and instead turn to the crip table that this research orients towards. This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their <em>Rest Assured</em> workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em> (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><span alt="Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T." src="../03_media/Rest Assured.png" class="internal-embed media-embed image-embed is-loaded"><img alt="Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T." src="thesis/repo/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.png"></span>{#fig:melt}</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">M.E.L.T.'s <em>Rest Assured</em> workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as "an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's <em>Artist in president</em> talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em>. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The <em>Life Affirming Organisational Practices</em> event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde<sup data-footnote-id="fnref-1-0450258fdbc979fc" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1-0450258fdbc979fc"><a data-footref="25" href="#fn-1-0450258fdbc979fc" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a></sup>, where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's <em>Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance</em> workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that "broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure.</p></div><div></div><div>

In many ways this is framed as a retreat in this work, of trying to put the violences of certain tables out of reach, and orient them towards notions, politics and practices of radical crip life affirmation. In this retreat though, and through a Crip understanding of the cyborg, we are still attached to and entangled with them. Through being in relation with these institutional tables of computing, academia and care, I can also shape them in return. It is this refusal to stay in line and to give feedback where it is not wanted. It is when I come to the operating table and finally talking back to the "expertise" of my "specialist", not only to refuse medicine and advice that will harm me, but also asking if he had ever read any disability studies? When he said no, I said, "Don't you think it is interesting you have never listened to the people you care for?" It is when I come to the computing table and the student account interface and feel the normative urge to police them for their attendance, to instead ask myself, "How do I care for this person and to be an ally in their building of capacities?" It is now that I have my own capacity to sit at research tables and send emails telling people what my needs are, and defining good boundaries around them. It is me writing this research and making wiggle room for these reflections and inquiries that maybe give too much information, emotion and anger, but offer within that the capacity to hold these necessary points and times out of line so to disorient and manifest this work from.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this dance I make many mistakes, I am clumsy, I am mad, I am Crip. In this dance I take just a few steps, a couple back, a number sideways. In this dance and between these tables, as I get to grips with them, as they try to shake me off, and as I try to hold on, I build my capacity to reorient them. The shaping effect that some have on me I also have on others, and it is within these frictions, flows, rhythms and moves that this research starts to manifest itself. Again, not through one point but a repetitive Crip-Tic and recursive practice of wiggling room within, between and around the capacities of these hard systems and institutes for our communities and their many tables to be cozily in relation.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="markdown-embed-content node-insert-event" style="display: none;"></div><div class="markdown-embed-link" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div><div class="canvas-node-content-blocker"></div></div><div class="canvas-node-label">03.05_Dancing_with_tables</div></div><div class="canvas-node is-themed mod-canvas-color-6" style="z-index: 8;
