thesis brings to the table my research into and practices of Configure-Able methods. These Configure-Able methods have emerged through my researches transdisciplinary approach, which brings together Queer Feminism, crip theory and Science and Technology Studies (STS). With this research approach I inquire around how to form wiggle room within the inherited norms of network and organisational infrastructures when configuring them out locally with communities. In this context I collaborated with a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective In-grid<a data-footref=\"y1\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and the initiation of a crip centred server space called the Cozy-Cloud<a data-footref=\"y2\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-2-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. With this question of \"is it Configure-Able?\" I inquired with them into how our communities, digital art collectives and crip servers can manifest their social and technical infrastructures to fit around our capacities, bodies and needs. In these inquiries we found friction with the determined roles, relations and matters we rubbed up against or were forced into. Here we orientedto trying to put our communities and their organisation/network configuring practices in touch with each other by distributing expertise through critical access, so that they can mutually affect the capacities, limits and horizons of each other. With my inquiries this has both oriented the configuration of network infrastructures and organisation practices to be more accessible to collective practices and dialogues, but also for these infrastructuring and organising practices themselves to be figured out by community impacted by them. This is where my work with critical access and crip theory disorients this research's approach and demands not for extra time or room around the inherited norm, but for community, interdependence and impact centred practices to become an indeterminate norm that we centre on when approaching configuring our collective infrastructures.<br>Configure-Able methods in this research makes wiggle room with communities by disorienting the figures of their social and technical configurations. Figures are the roles<a data-footref=\"y3\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-3-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, stories<a data-footref=\"y4\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-4-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and metaphors<a data-footref=\"y5\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-5-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> that orient and lay out the plans that go on to be configured into infrastructures. So when, with Configure-able methods in my collaborations, when we start to disorient their figures from the ground up, such as users as carer, servers as collaborators and security as safety through intimacy the plans and their configurations drastically change. This is especially emphasised in my turn to radical disability politics of crip theory and its disobedience that goes beyond the talking about frictions we have with the figures and politics, to reorient to making friction through direct action and configuring out our own local improvisation together where possible. This direct action in my collaborative inquiries have even been simple things like admitting our collective orientation and ethics is out of reach for now. In this acknowledgement though, is a figuring out together what we do want and how to wiggle towards the room this needs together. These actions have also been more material movements such as collectively manifesting In-grid's first server infrastructure, as well as forming a ccrip centred server called the Cozy-Cloud. Through these inquiries and reflections I aim to offer up forms and capacities that these Configure-Able methodology not only enact, but demand!Later on in this chapter I go through a closer reading of the thesis and give an overview of each chapter to orient them to be more accessible. Next though I go through figuring the background of this research, which is a recurring move in this thesis. Bringing focus to the background gives room, contour and shape for figures and bodies to emerge from. In this initial background I give a short introduction to why my research and practice disobediently oriented towards the emergence of Configure-able methods through collective and community centred organisation and infrastructuring. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://cozy-cloud.net/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-2-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>User, Designer, Server, Client, Expert<a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-3-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Of zero trust internet networks, security as privacy and centralised control as achievable.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-4-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Secure Shell (SSH) handshakes, firewalls and chronic jobs.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-5-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction","level":1,"id":"Introduction_0"}],"links":["01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-2-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-3-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-4-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fn-5-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-2-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-3-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-4-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html#fnref-5-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612756,"modifiedTime":1756048612757,"sourceSize":4281,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.00_Intro.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html":{"title":"01.01.00_Background","icon":"","description":"In a way this background to the research is so far away and so small on its metaphorical horizon that it only takes up this small section of the introduction. I still find it important to mention these now distant inquiries as it offers many of the reasons for why these Configure-able methods, my collaborative inquiries and this thesis have come into being. Coming into this PhD I was very much following the norms of computer science, and even though I had been tought to code creatively I had still been taught how to optimise code, automate decisions and of course train AI models to make them for me. With this sedimented norm in place, even though I was fairly set on collective knowledge creation, I of course started by making many different bits of code, databases, and critiques of how AI might do things with us or for us.As I proceeded in this inherited practise and normalised path I started to read up and relate more to crip theory and its critiques of technology. One of these critiques that surfaced was of AI and computations histories and practices that originate from those of eugenics. Eugenics as a phony science believes that we can shape and cure the human race of unwanted and feeble minded individuals through genetic selection, and has a long history of violence toward disabled people and many other marginalised groups. Wendy Chun in here book Discriminating Data (2021) covers how these algorithms work on both mathematics and social levels through not only these eugenic logics, but also segregationist algorithms that split people into groups via different physical and social \"features\". Timnit Gebru and Émile Torres in their essay \"The TESCREAL bundle\" (2024), and as part of D.A.I.R.<a data-footref=\"y6\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, also bring together current histories of how eugenic genetic curing have also been accelerated into silicon valley transhumanist imaginaries that cure humanity of our feeble and disposable bodies as a way to reach a \"net good\". To find this cure they are of course gambling everything on the yet out of reach Artificial Generalised Intelligence (AGI) and its unknown and often undeclared capabilities. Johannes Bruder in his chapter AI as medium and message (2023, 171) where he discuses how the imaginaries of AI both fetishise and want to cure Autistic and neurodiverse individuals in particular.Later on in the flipping table (chap) I go on to talk more closely about crip takes on technology, and Alison Kafer's (Kafer 2013) crip critique of transhumanism, and this crip refusal of the imaginary and need to cure people through these ever unferling and never in reach speculative future technologies. In response Kafer offers a refusal of a future cure to instead to orient to what is in reach. In changing this focus, Kafer is asking how can communities form social and technologies politics and relations that can manifest the care and affirmative infrastructures now?When inquiring through practise with AI, I developed a number of different speculative works to reflect through what was in reach of me with AI. These ranged from situated community made datasets that questioned the normalisation and isolation of indexes, as well as interactive bits of code that made accessible how AI algorithms segment space. The type of AI that I particularly oriented towards though and got to know through practice was that of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This was partially due to deepminds work with \"mastering\" Go and other closed system games (Silver et al. 2016; 2017), and as this made room to hype up to be the part of RL/AI that could encounter new things, the unknown, or be \"creative\". It was also because it could be used to train multi-agent environments and I wanted to explore how to form environments of collaboration and organisation within these terms. I went on to form works with RL, with the main one trying to configure these \"agents\" so that the group of them could communicate to one another through abstract patterns and emerge their own visual language and representation of their environment together. These came out okay, but I ended up desisting from working with them for a few reasons. The main one was after a while I realised that the logics of the RL algorithm that was supposed to enable AI to encounter the unknown, and within AGI imaginaries cure every yet unknown problem, was in simple a penal logic. This meant that the only feedback was to punish or reward the agent to reinforce it to form a \"policy\" for that environments task. It was also well noted to only work well in time sensitive environments if you keep giving a constant punishment to the agents at every step. In practice this system was very uncreative, the agent was mostly not understanding what you wanted it to do and always trying to trick the rules you laid out to just get the max points. When working in this relationship especially it I tried to figure out a relation and dynamic where I did not have to \"master\" or train them to get them to learn anything. Another reason is that I felt that a lot of this practice that I had done was very closed off and hard to collaborate with others through. Here I realised that for me to use AI critically and sustainably in any of my local community contexts was fairly far out of my reach at the time. None of this made this technology either accessible or desirable to me after a while. I slowly stopped to work with these AI agents in the end, as there seemed no way to collaborate with them without executing, mastering or punishing them, and the agents always seemed to want to run away or escape when we came into contact under these terms.<br>Another more direct explanation of this is again from D.A.I.R., but this time from an episode of the Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000 podcast by linguist Prof.&nbsp;Emily M. Bender and sociologist Dr.&nbsp;Alex Hanna. In this podcast they often playfully take apart AI papers and their critical underpinning. I bring this podcast up though as I want to focus on Bender's critique of LLM's in the Can Machines Learn To Behave? Part 3 (Hanna and Bender 2022). As she puts it<a data-footref=\"y7\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html#fn-2-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, there are so many ways of modelling language that exist, and yet they try to fit it all through this one single algorithm that is based on eugenics, not overule any prior histories and practices of language or linguistics. In a similar orientation I realised that yes I might be able to organise with my community through AI and to fold up our issues into abstract eugenics logics to automate our decisions, but in doing this we lose the capacity and room to emerge the many other logics and algorithms that we can interdependently and locally manifest ourselves together from our divergent backgrounds. So as I disorient away from this background of a cured future through automation I ask how with the collaborations of this thesis I can make space for us to move beyond these normalising practises of computing that prescribed generalised logics of organisation onto our community? Through this thesis' research and its inquiries I felt out these Configure-Able methods as a way to form a response to this question and inquire into how communities can come together to configure out their social and technical infrastructures and politics locally.Just to be clear this is not a total refusal of AI or to say that algorithms are defined by their origins. It is instead to acknowledge these histories and the limits of their logics when we do work with them. With this crip relation to technology, it is to be okay with technologies messiness, but to actively take care around/within their limits. For instance in my inquiries, it is to be okay with the AI speech to text algorithm that we have for now, but to both orient towards community driven and joyous live captions Like I did in my inquiries, but also to centres stenographer/transcription knowledges within automated captioning technologies like Louise Hickman's cripping of AI (Louise Hickman 2021). For Laura Forlano as well, is to be okay with the automated AI insulin pen (2023) and it's buggines, but in this to again centre points of impact and the person's embodied experience to these technologies in our critique of them. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dair-institute.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.dair-institute.org/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Um but also then he goes on to say \"Real insight began to emerge with word2vec\" which is one of these first sort of neural approaches to language modeling.

The fields I work across here are Queer Feminism, crip theory, and Feminist STS. I initially align with Sarah Ahmed's Queer Phenomenology (2006) to think through her concepts of orientation, sedimentation and the bodily horizon. I do this to think around what is in reach, and how inherited relations can orient me so that my contingent (other queer) desires are out of reach. I also surface her soft body and the ways it make room for me to think about the impressions I make on others (and them on me) and the technologies we stay in touch with. With Kafer's concepts I aim to highlight the situated ways of approaching technologies through social relations, as well as the capacity to mutually affect and transform them and the ways I practice them through radical Queer and crip politics.I then orient closely to crip theory to feel out the radical politics that I want to put in touch with these bodies of technoscience, network infrastructuring and collective organising. To do this I take up a reading of Alison Kafer's Feminist, Queer and crip, (2013) among other works, to emerge my own understanding of her Political/Relational Model, crip time, and a crip intersectionality. With these I highlight an understanding of crip theory as a place that has the capacity to disorient our inherited and normalised organisation and networking practices through the radical capacities of interdependence, care and critical access. With Kafer I also take up a close reading of her figure of the disabled body in technology, or the cyborg, stepping out of line to be a situated body and horizon to map and configure technologies on their own terms.With Kafer's later Manifesting Manifestos (2023) and her Health Rebels (2017) talk, I bring about the crip manifesto and manifestings as a practice and framing for this research. As Kafer describes it, how can we form a crazed practice of crip manifestos, each imperfection, flaw and friction offering each iteration orientation towards a future crips need and desire now. Here I also touch on Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) to orient this crazed crip manifesting towards STS and to inquire more closely into the social and technical practices of infrastructures. Their manifesto importantly for this work offering up how friction is felt and made felt by others through the direct action of crip technoscience. With them I take this up in my research to ask how we can centre the knowledge of people at the sites of impact within the infrastructures that not only support their communities but affirm their lives.With this chapter I aim to offer up this approach of a crazed crip manifesting of manifestos as a way to orient my research away from the inherited and sedimented norms of collective infrastructures. Through these practices of manifesting disorientations I aim to bring in reach a practice of community network infrastructuring that draws from crip Theory and a version of STS that is sensitive to the inaccessibility of roles, language and politics that science and technology normalise.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disability justice and life affirmation flipping the table","level":3,"id":"Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.01_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612757,"modifiedTime":1756048612758,"sourceSize":3421,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.02.01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.01_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.02_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html":{"title":"01.02.02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> accompanies the last one as a way to bring in the embodied feelings and knowledges of the ableist relations that I theoretically explained in the last chapter but have also experienced during my PhD and wider work. I do this as it is important for my research around disability to be situated at my table and contextualised from the experiences I have had. This chapter aims to bring in much of the background and labour that is often negated or hidden from view of the research table. It refuses to hide these Queer and crip relations, but also to acknowledge my bodily horizon as a gender queer disabled white middle class person, and make that experience and context somewhat knowable in this research.The crip-tic itself plays on the fractal scales of a tic or stim that is discussed in Get The Frac In! (Maier et al. 2020), unpredictable, indefinite and recursive. This also plays with the scales of Tych (diptych, triptych, etc.) in painting, where different paintings are held together in indeterminate compositions. I work with this composition of a crip-tic to offer up insights into some of the bodies I have come into contact with during this research. The crip-tic also aims to be left open to further Tics and indeterminate instances of crip experience that go well out of my reach and make room for the readers to add their own context. The very crip tics that I surface here are a number of tables and normalised relations I have encountered within the UK institutional context where I am based, and which I go through below.The first table I come to is the Research Table(chap), where I reflect on the frictions I felt when I was taken up as a crip research object by an emerging X Digital Futures Institute. Here I highlight the ways these researchers, and the norms of research they were operating with, made no room for intimacy with the radial politics and practices of crip studies, and in practice infantilised and undermined the possibilities of these politics in action. In reflecting on these frictions I aim to flip the table on how this research table, like many before it, does not have the capacity for, and is not yet in reach of the sorts of radical intimacy and access that crip practices demand.I then go on to feel out the second table of the Computing Table (chap), where I reflect on being in relation to the ex-cell table of institutions. Here I orient it through both being an access and care requester towards my own medical needs, as well as being a teacher and care giver within institutions. Both of these orientations reflect on a computing table that is configured to not make room for people's voices or needs. These tables are instead oriented to extract specific figures and data from people to hold them in place in their determined ex-cell.The third crip-tic orients my most recent experiences of the Operating Table (chap) and institutional medical model of care. This tic reflects on how I was treated when I had a flair up with my health condition and tried to get care from these institutions. It offers up an insight into the sick crip times that are currently operated by these institutions in the UK and how they are nowhere near in reach of offering me (or others) the care I knew I needed. This inquiry and encounter was a reminder that we are often left off worse by the operations and treatments normalised by these tables of institutional \"care\". This reflection aims to highlight how the medical model exists in my experience and contextualises it to the current UK political climate of living in the aftermath of austerity cuts to social care.The final table I come to is the crip table, where I reflect on my experiences of coming to tables and rooms of disability justice and life affirmation. This was a wide range of things but I just touch upon some workshops by M.E.L.T. called Rest Assured that I attended, as well as a day-ong symposium by Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. In both of these experiences I reflect on how being in touch with both their practices of access and capacities for people's needs induced a sense making of guilt. With this I realised that this feeling of guilt came from the lack of these capacities that I had in myself but also in the relations I had in reach at that time. This sense making also oriented me to know, feel and figure out what sort of access, affirmation and change I wanted to orient towards within my collective social and technical practices.I poetically sum up this chapter, aiming to bring these tables I am in touch withwith those in theory and giving a material background of these crip-tics that will be flipped. This is also left open to make room for them and this research to be disoriented by both the reader's own situated experiences, as well as those of the community and relational tables I approach throughout the rest of this research. These two first chapters make aim to offer up a bed for this research to then lay its disobedient methodology comfortably atop of.

Disobedient Action Research stems from Action Research (AR), which is a type of research that centres practitioners as knowledge creators through doing, making and being in relation to the material world. Disobedient AR specifically emerges from a type of AR called First Person AR, which Judi Marsh established with her notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty &amp; Marshall, 2021; Marshall, 1999, 2004). Living Life as Inquiry and First Person AR orient to situate themselves further within the role of the practitioner as a knowledge maker. It does this by making room for the practitioner to bring their background, context and embodied feelings into their research practice (otherwise known as their first person perspective). This offers a type of research where we have the capacity to acknowledge where the research is coming from contextually and relationally, as well as emotionally.Disobedient Action Research, which TITiPI as well as Possible Bodies (Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021; TITiPI, Ango, and Lepage 2022) established, in some ways extends this orientation, but in other ways troubles it. Disobedient Action Reseach extends it through making room for us to do First Person Action Research interdependently. This moves the knowledge making process from being within the self, to in between the collective embodied selves. Disobedient Action Research also troubles First Person Action Research by making demands of direct action and change. Even though First Person AR calls for \"change agents\", it is Disobedient AR that orients to question the limits change agents can make. Specifically in the context of computer science and open source software community Possible Bodies ask questions like what of the big issues we feel around computing can actually be broken down and squeezed like (code) bugs? And how can we give feedback and get feedback from places where it is purposefully lacking?I chose to use Disobedient Action Research as it aligns well with my existing practice as a creative developer and community practitioner. It also makes ample room for my context of being a crip researcher, one where I question the scales and limits of politics and their relations. In this it questions what participating within their defined limits offers us, and for us to inquire into how to make change around, within and to those limits. Disobedient AR also makes room for me to work with the collectives and communities that I do, and to try to feel out our collective, local and embodied refusal of Big Tech. Disobedient AR as a methodology in practice also made room for me to develop my own Configure-Able methods, which is what I go on to emerge throughout the rest of this thesis.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disobedient Action Research Cycles","level":3,"id":"Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_0"}],"links":["04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.00_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.03_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612758,"modifiedTime":1756048612758,"sourceSize":3087,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.02.03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.03_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html":{"title":"01.02.04_Configure-able_methods","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> is one of the first actions of manifesting through inquiry within this thesis. In it I start to lay down the foundational inquiries into Configure-Able methods by cripping Science and Technology Studies (STS) methods. I start by forming an accessible genealogy of configuration working with Celia Lury et al.'s chapter on Figure, Figuring and Configuration (2022). This genealogy moves from figures as abstract stories, roles and statistics, that we imagine and represent society through, to configuring how these figured plans and stories are brought into material action. I specifically highlight the work of Lucy Suchman's Configuration (2012) as it is both an accessible and quality discussion of a feminist approach to configuration. I particularly take her up as in her essay works with configuration to critique the data management and organisational infrastructure projects of medical care institutions, their supporting politics, and the development of their future care infrastructures.<br>With this genealogy and with Suchman's (ibid) example I inquire into how configuration can be disoriented when put in touch with crip theory? What practices and capacities does a crip Configuration give room for? To do this, I initially set up a framing with Aimi Hamraie's critique of the figure of the user within disability design history and its roots within eugenic industrial design logics that reinforce and shape soft bodies to hard systems. With Hamraie's critique I orient to question how I can challenge the role of the user by distributing the expertise through collective interdependent inquiry. To do this moving to practices of access knowledge formed through design frictions. To do this I reflect on a workshop I ran with NEoN digital<a data-footref=\"q8\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> in Dundee who are a community based organisation focusing on digital access. These workshops in themselves oriented network accessibility, collective action and Feminist server practices. My inquiry approaches these workshops through a first person reflection and focus on my experiences of configuring access for the first time for an event like this, and how I tried to do this (where possible) through interdependent joy, and impact centred care. In this inquiry reflecting on how distributing the role of the expert within my collaborative group made room for us to challenge the capacity of configuration as access making. In this move disorienting the centralised and prescribed plans of normative configuration through the points of friction and impact we felt as a group together.I then return to Suchman's Configuration (2012) to bring it into contact with this inquiry and these experiences. I do this by taking up disability in her critique where it has been left abscent and invalid from its own dialogues. By giving feedback as a disabled voice to her analysis of the configuration of medical care systems and their politics I imagine what capacities the people with disability at the site of impact of these systems might want from configuration. Here I try to make room to figure out how to uplift their capacity to communicate their needs, feelings and agency through Configure-Able methods. This again very disobediently poses Configure-Able as a question and a prompt, so I can ask how Configure-Able is this relation, infrastructure and politics? Am I supported by it? Or held in place? And how can my collaborators and I orient around the frictions we feel and make room for them to inform our collective configuration practices. This chapter builds up these methods for the next two sections to work through in practice and situate them to be made knowable within different contexts, collaborations and practices. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://neondigitalarts.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://neondigitalarts.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Configure-able methods","level":3,"id":"Configure-able_methods_0"}],"links":[".html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612758,"modifiedTime":1756048612759,"sourceSize":3856,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_Configure-able_methods.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.05_in-configure-ability.html":{"title":"01.02.05_In-configure-ability","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> covers one of the inquiries into situating Configure-Able methods within embedded collective practice. To do this I collaborated with In-grid, a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective I helped to set up in 2020. In this context, I worked with the collective to situate Configure-Able methods within our practices to make room for practices for figuring out how we wanted to organise ourselves and our digital network infrastructure together. In doing this, we also queried how we were organised by the inherited relations of our pre-existing social and technical infrastructures that we came in touch with. To inquire into this with In-grid, I have been working through Disobedient AR to practise how these Configure-Able methods can come into being over a reasonable period of time (2+ years) and within an embedded intersectional community. To reflect on this collaboration organised a focus group, where In-grid members collectively figured out our organisational practises together and reflecting on how we had been impacted by the systemic inflexibilities, and in turn how we had collectivley oriented and flexed (where possible) to refuse these normalised tables and relations, to make room for our own. I follow this up with a first person AR reflections around In-grid's technical knowledge sharing practices, informing the group both with Kelsie Acton's notion of Plain Language (2023) to make room for us to orient from and centre critical access. I also reflect on the work with In-grid to develop the Practising Protocols workshops for 4S/EASST, making room for people to disorient these server practices through their embodied and distributed expertise. I this builds to a key focus on a later iteration of these workshops I ran internaly for In-grid, and playfully named (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This internal workshop emerged a collective table of expertise from which we coalesced In-grid's iteration of the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant 2015), called the Femfester which was published in the first edition of Artist Running Datacentres jounral (Simms et al. 2024).This chapter aims to bring to this research table the many scales that I have been manifesting Configure-Able methods within my collaborations with In-grid. By situating these methods in an intersectional collective practice I offer up how critical access can not only be an extra we add on to our social and technical practices but something that can be orient from and action with. In this disorientation of configuration in action we made room for our plans in action to reverberate from the bodies, figures and relations they were in touch with, making wiggle room for In-grid to exist within, around and beyond the sedimented and inherited limits we impacted by.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"In-configure-ability","level":3,"id":"In-configure-ability_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.05_in-configure-ability.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612759,"modifiedTime":1756048612759,"sourceSize":3015,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.02.05_In-configure-ability.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.05_in-configure-ability.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html":{"title":"01.02.06_A_Cozier_Configure-Ability","icon":"","description":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.00_Intro.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.00_Intro</a> reflects on a second inquiry into Configure-Able methods. In this context I wanted to inquire into how I could start to form a crip centred network practice. To do this I formed the Cozy-Cloud as a server space that was made for and by disabled people. This server acts as wiggle room for collaborators and me to try to configure out what life affirming network infrastructures might be like in action. This inquiry into a configure-able crip cloud is developed through both manifesting cripped technical infrastructure, but also the social relations of interdependent care that not only produced but maintain this crip network infrastructure. In this inquiry I surface two artistic works that share how these localised crip centred manifestations of Configure-Able methods have come into being.The first work explores my manifesting of cozy intentions for the server as I initially made it. These intentions were made by developing a set of sticker and alt text pairs. This work by centring alt texts as medium configure access to the front of their composition to highlight the capacity that access practices already have. These capacities of access in the alt texts both lay in them being able to communicate the images content to wider audiences with sensory differences, but also makes the alt text accessible within reduced internet bandwidth that cannot support images. Through these sticker and alt text pairs I poetically manifest a set of cozy intentions for the Cozy-Cloud to emerge from. Each of these forming their own multi-media non-linear orientation for what this server and infrastructure is intending to make room for and within. These intentions in message orient towards forming network infrastructures that do not rely on imaginaries of infinite growth, weaponized economies and exhaustive relations. They intend to do this by making room for computational practices and network infrastructures that intimately retreat away from their militaristic origins and imaginaries. Alongside these intentions I also manifested the Cozy-Cloud relaxation space for people to be in reach of this crip server infrastructure and its cozy intentions in a relaxing calm environment. To emphasise this multi-sensory/media set of intentions I also made cozy fluffy cushions, a printable easy read version of the cozy intentions and physical versions of the stickers, so that those visiting can interact and feel these intentions in a way that is comfy and accessible to them. In doing this opening up how I can form many ways of communicating these technical relations and my intedned approaches towards them so that people can be in touch with them, and figure them out through their own embodied knowing and expertise.<br>The second work I surface in this chapter is that of the En-crip-ing Time, which was a collaboration with Marianna Marongoni<a data-footref=\"q9\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This work inquired into how to crip both the time and intimacies of the Cozy-Cloud server and its relations to network infrastructures. To do this we configured out our own poetic performance of cron jobs (deterministic and routine maintenance jobs on Unix operating systems) as chronic jobs (indeterminate, indefinite care and maintenance through intimacy). To make room for crip times here we hacked multiple bits of code and syntax to wiggle room within the existing infrastructural limits of network time for our poetic crip times. In this work we also highlight the social aspects of making the infrastructure together, and how to do this we made room for each other, our capacities and our needs so that this crip infrastructure could come into being. I also touch upon the essay that we wrote for Brand-New-Life about the work (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025), and where we try to blur the boundaries, variability and formats of academic texts to both hold technical dialogues, but also the very crip feeling Marianna and I had around them.I conclude the chapter by both reflecting back at these projects and how they have transformed network practices by bring them in touch with crip bodies, tables and politics, but also to orient forward to the futures that the Cozy-Cloud is approaching. This future is one of slowly building up more collaborations and infrastructures to figure out in action what accessible and configure-able crip network practices can be. Whatever may lay in the indeterminate future of the Cozy-Cloud, I know we will orient from critical access today, to make room for life affirming infrastructures of tomorrow. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://marianamarangoni.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://marianamarangoni.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"A Cozier Configure-Ability","level":3,"id":"A_Cozier_Configure-Ability_0"}],"links":[".html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html#fn-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html#fnref-1-9be4ab6d1df5ceb7_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612759,"modifiedTime":1756048612759,"sourceSize":4652,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_A_Cozier_Configure-Ability.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_entries/01.03.00_conclusion.html":{"title":"01.03.00_Conclusion","icon":"","description":"This thesis and its inquiries go on to shape in action what Configure-able methods can be in these localities.

These Configure-Able methods have emerged through my researches transdisciplinary approach, which brings together Queer Feminism, crip theory and Science and Technology Studies (STS). With this research approach I inquire around how to form wiggle room within the inherited norms of network and organisational infrastructures when configuring them out locally with communities. In this context I collaborated with a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective In-grid<a data-footref=\"y1\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and the initiation of a crip centred server space called the Cozy-Cloud<a data-footref=\"y2\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-2-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. With this question of \"is it Configure-Able?\" I inquired with them into how our communities, digital art collectives and crip servers can manifest their social and technical infrastructures to fit around our capacities, bodies and needs. In these inquiries we found friction with the determined roles, relations and matters we rubbed up against or were forced into. Here we orientedto trying to put our communities and their organisation/network configuring practices in touch with each other by distributing expertise through critical access, so that they can mutually affect the capacities, limits and horizons of each other. With my inquiries this has both oriented the configuration of network infrastructures and organisation practices to be more accessible to collective practices and dialogues, but also for these infrastructuring and organising practices themselves to be figured out by community impacted by them. This is where my work with critical access and crip theory disorients this research's approach and demands not for extra time or room around the inherited norm, but for community, interdependence and impact centred practices to become an indeterminate norm that we centre on when approaching configuring our collective infrastructures.<br>Configure-Able methods in this research makes wiggle room with communities by disorienting the figures of their social and technical configurations. Figures are the roles<a data-footref=\"y3\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-3-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, stories<a data-footref=\"y4\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-4-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and metaphors<a data-footref=\"y5\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-5-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> that orient and lay out the plans that go on to be configured into infrastructures. So when, with Configure-able methods in my collaborations, when we start to disorient their figures from the ground up, such as users as carer, servers as collaborators and security as safety through intimacy the plans and their configurations drastically change. This is especially emphasised in my turn to radical disability politics of crip theory and its disobedience that goes beyond the talking about frictions we have with the figures and politics, to reorient to making friction through direct action and configuring out our own local improvisation together where possible. This direct action in my collaborative inquiries have even been simple things like admitting our collective orientation and ethics is out of reach for now. In this acknowledgement though, is a figuring out together what we do want and how to wiggle towards the room this needs together. These actions have also been more material movements such as collectively manifesting In-grid's first server infrastructure, as well as forming a ccrip centred server called the Cozy-Cloud. Through these inquiries and reflections I aim to offer up forms and capacities that these Configure-Able methodology not only enact, but demand!Later on in this chapter I go through a closer reading of the thesis and give an overview of each chapter to orient them to be more accessible. Next though I go through figuring the background of this research, which is a recurring move in this thesis. Bringing focus to the background gives room, contour and shape for figures and bodies to emerge from. In this initial background I give a short introduction to why my research and practice disobediently oriented towards the emergence of Configure-able methods through collective and community centred organisation and infrastructuring. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://cozy-cloud.net/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-2-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>User, Designer, Server, Client, Expert<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-3-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Of zero trust internet networks, security as privacy and centralised control as achievable.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-4-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Secure Shell (SSH) handshakes, firewalls and chronic jobs.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-5-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 01.01.00_BackgroundIn a way this background to the research is so far away and so small on its metaphorical horizon that it only takes up this small section of the introduction. I still find it important to mention these now distant inquiries as it offers many of the reasons for why these Configure-able methods, my collaborative inquiries and this thesis have come into being. Coming into this PhD I was very much following the norms of computer science, and even though I had been tought to code creatively I had still been taught how to optimise code, automate decisions and of course train AI models to make them for me. With this sedimented norm in place, even though I was fairly set on collective knowledge creation, I of course started by making many different bits of code, databases, and critiques of how AI might do things with us or for us.<br>As I proceeded in this inherited practise and normalised path I started to read up and relate more to crip theory and its critiques of technology. One of these critiques that surfaced was of AI and computations histories and practices that originate from those of eugenics. Eugenics as a phony science believes that we can shape and cure the human race of unwanted and feeble minded individuals through genetic selection, and has a long history of violence toward disabled people and many other marginalised groups. Wendy Chun in here book Discriminating Data (2021) covers how these algorithms work on both mathematics and social levels through not only these eugenic logics, but also segregationist algorithms that split people into groups via different physical and social \"features\". Timnit Gebru and Émile Torres in their essay \"The TESCREAL bundle\" (2024), and as part of D.A.I.R.<a data-footref=\"y6\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-90ecb6da99c64a34_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, also bring together current histories of how eugenic genetic curing have also been accelerated into silicon valley transhumanist imaginaries that cure humanity of our feeble and disposable bodies as a way to reach a \"net good\". To find this cure they are of course gambling everything on the yet out of reach Artificial Generalised Intelligence (AGI) and its unknown and often undeclared capabilities. Johannes Bruder in his chapter AI as medium and message (2023, 171) where he discuses how the imaginaries of AI both fetishise and want to cure Autistic and neurodiverse individuals in particular.Later on in the flipping table (chap) I go on to talk more closely about crip takes on technology, and Alison Kafer's (Kafer 2013) crip critique of transhumanism, and this crip refusal of the imaginary and need to cure people through these ever unferling and never in reach speculative future technologies. In response Kafer offers a refusal of a future cure to instead to orient to what is in reach. In changing this focus, Kafer is asking how can communities form social and technologies politics and relations that can manifest the care and affirmative infrastructures now?When inquiring through practise with AI, I developed a number of different speculative works to reflect through what was in reach of me with AI. These ranged from situated community made datasets that questioned the normalisation and isolation of indexes, as well as interactive bits of code that made accessible how AI algorithms segment space. The type of AI that I particularly oriented towards though and got to know through practice was that of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This was partially due to deepminds work with \"mastering\" Go and other closed system games (Silver et al. 2016; 2017), and as this made room to hype up to be the part of RL/AI that could encounter new things, the unknown, or be \"creative\". It was also because it could be used to train multi-agent environments and I wanted to explore how to form environments of collaboration and organisation within these terms. I went on to form works with RL, with the main one trying to configure these \"agents\" so that the group of them could communicate to one another through abstract patterns and emerge their own visual language and representation of their environment together. These came out okay, but I ended up desisting from working with them for a few reasons. The main one was after a while I realised that the logics of the RL algorithm that was supposed to enable AI to encounter the unknown, and within AGI imaginaries cure every yet unknown problem, was in simple a penal logic. This meant that the only feedback was to punish or reward the agent to reinforce it to form a \"policy\" for that environments task. It was also well noted to only work well in time sensitive environments if you keep giving a constant punishment to the agents at every step. In practice this system was very uncreative, the agent was mostly not understanding what you wanted it to do and always trying to trick the rules you laid out to just get the max points. When working in this relationship especially it I tried to figure out a relation and dynamic where I did not have to \"master\" or train them to get them to learn anything. Another reason is that I felt that a lot of this practice that I had done was very closed off and hard to collaborate with others through. Here I realised that for me to use AI critically and sustainably in any of my local community contexts was fairly far out of my reach at the time. None of this made this technology either accessible or desirable to me after a while. I slowly stopped to work with these AI agents in the end, as there seemed no way to collaborate with them without executing, mastering or punishing them, and the agents always seemed to want to run away or escape when we came into contact under these terms.<br>Another more direct explanation of this is again from D.A.I.R., but this time from an episode of the Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000 podcast by linguist Prof.&nbsp;Emily M. Bender and sociologist Dr.&nbsp;Alex Hanna. In this podcast they often playfully take apart AI papers and their critical underpinning. I bring this podcast up though as I want to focus on Bender's critique of LLM's in the Can Machines Learn To Behave? Part 3 (Hanna and Bender 2022). As she puts it<a data-footref=\"y7\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-2-90ecb6da99c64a34_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, there are so many ways of modelling language that exist, and yet they try to fit it all through this one single algorithm that is based on eugenics, not overule any prior histories and practices of language or linguistics. In a similar orientation I realised that yes I might be able to organise with my community through AI and to fold up our issues into abstract eugenics logics to automate our decisions, but in doing this we lose the capacity and room to emerge the many other logics and algorithms that we can interdependently and locally manifest ourselves together from our divergent backgrounds. So as I disorient away from this background of a cured future through automation I ask how with the collaborations of this thesis I can make space for us to move beyond these normalising practises of computing that prescribed generalised logics of organisation onto our community? Through this thesis' research and its inquiries I felt out these Configure-Able methods as a way to form a response to this question and inquire into how communities can come together to configure out their social and technical infrastructures and politics locally.Just to be clear this is not a total refusal of AI or to say that algorithms are defined by their origins. It is instead to acknowledge these histories and the limits of their logics when we do work with them. With this crip relation to technology, it is to be okay with technologies messiness, but to actively take care around/within their limits. For instance in my inquiries, it is to be okay with the AI speech to text algorithm that we have for now, but to both orient towards community driven and joyous live captions Like I did in my inquiries, but also to centres stenographer/transcription knowledges within automated captioning technologies like Louise Hickman's cripping of AI (Louise Hickman 2021). For Laura Forlano as well, is to be okay with the automated AI insulin pen (2023) and it's buggines, but in this to again centre points of impact and the person's embodied experience to these technologies in our critique of them. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dair-institute.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.dair-institute.org/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-90ecb6da99c64a34_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Um but also then he goes on to say \"Real insight began to emerge with word2vec\" which is one of these first sort of neural approaches to language modeling.

The fields I work across here are Queer Feminism, crip theory, and Feminist STS. I initially align with Sarah Ahmed's Queer Phenomenology (2006) to think through her concepts of orientation, sedimentation and the bodily horizon. I do this to think around what is in reach, and how inherited relations can orient me so that my contingent (other queer) desires are out of reach. I also surface her soft body and the ways it make room for me to think about the impressions I make on others (and them on me) and the technologies we stay in touch with. With Kafer's concepts I aim to highlight the situated ways of approaching technologies through social relations, as well as the capacity to mutually affect and transform them and the ways I practice them through radical Queer and crip politics.I then orient closely to crip theory to feel out the radical politics that I want to put in touch with these bodies of technoscience, network infrastructuring and collective organising. To do this I take up a reading of Alison Kafer's Feminist, Queer and crip, (2013) among other works, to emerge my own understanding of her Political/Relational Model, crip time, and a crip intersectionality. With these I highlight an understanding of crip theory as a place that has the capacity to disorient our inherited and normalised organisation and networking practices through the radical capacities of interdependence, care and critical access. With Kafer I also take up a close reading of her figure of the disabled body in technology, or the cyborg, stepping out of line to be a situated body and horizon to map and configure technologies on their own terms.With Kafer's later Manifesting Manifestos (2023) and her Health Rebels (2017) talk, I bring about the crip manifesto and manifestings as a practice and framing for this research. As Kafer describes it, how can we form a crazed practice of crip manifestos, each imperfection, flaw and friction offering each iteration orientation towards a future crips need and desire now. Here I also touch on Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) to orient this crazed crip manifesting towards STS and to inquire more closely into the social and technical practices of infrastructures. Their manifesto importantly for this work offering up how friction is felt and made felt by others through the direct action of crip technoscience. With them I take this up in my research to ask how we can centre the knowledge of people at the sites of impact within the infrastructures that not only support their communities but affirm their lives.With this chapter I aim to offer up this approach of a crazed crip manifesting of manifestos as a way to orient my research away from the inherited and sedimented norms of collective infrastructures. Through these practices of manifesting disorientations I aim to bring in reach a practice of community network infrastructuring that draws from crip Theory and a version of STS that is sensitive to the inaccessibility of roles, language and politics that science and technology normalise.\n01.02.02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> accompanies the last one as a way to bring in the embodied feelings and knowledges of the ableist relations that I theoretically explained in the last chapter but have also experienced during my PhD and wider work. I do this as it is important for my research around disability to be situated at my table and contextualised from the experiences I have had. This chapter aims to bring in much of the background and labour that is often negated or hidden from view of the research table. It refuses to hide these Queer and crip relations, but also to acknowledge my bodily horizon as a gender queer disabled white middle class person, and make that experience and context somewhat knowable in this research.The crip-tic itself plays on the fractal scales of a tic or stim that is discussed in Get The Frac In! (Maier et al. 2020), unpredictable, indefinite and recursive. This also plays with the scales of Tych (diptych, triptych, etc.) in painting, where different paintings are held together in indeterminate compositions. I work with this composition of a crip-tic to offer up insights into some of the bodies I have come into contact with during this research. The crip-tic also aims to be left open to further Tics and indeterminate instances of crip experience that go well out of my reach and make room for the readers to add their own context. The very crip tics that I surface here are a number of tables and normalised relations I have encountered within the UK institutional context where I am based, and which I go through below.The first table I come to is the Research Table(chap), where I reflect on the frictions I felt when I was taken up as a crip research object by an emerging X Digital Futures Institute. Here I highlight the ways these researchers, and the norms of research they were operating with, made no room for intimacy with the radial politics and practices of crip studies, and in practice infantilised and undermined the possibilities of these politics in action. In reflecting on these frictions I aim to flip the table on how this research table, like many before it, does not have the capacity for, and is not yet in reach of the sorts of radical intimacy and access that crip practices demand.I then go on to feel out the second table of the Computing Table (chap), where I reflect on being in relation to the ex-cell table of institutions. Here I orient it through both being an access and care requester towards my own medical needs, as well as being a teacher and care giver within institutions. Both of these orientations reflect on a computing table that is configured to not make room for people's voices or needs. These tables are instead oriented to extract specific figures and data from people to hold them in place in their determined ex-cell.The third crip-tic orients my most recent experiences of the Operating Table (chap) and institutional medical model of care. This tic reflects on how I was treated when I had a flair up with my health condition and tried to get care from these institutions. It offers up an insight into the sick crip times that are currently operated by these institutions in the UK and how they are nowhere near in reach of offering me (or others) the care I knew I needed. This inquiry and encounter was a reminder that we are often left off worse by the operations and treatments normalised by these tables of institutional \"care\". This reflection aims to highlight how the medical model exists in my experience and contextualises it to the current UK political climate of living in the aftermath of austerity cuts to social care.The final table I come to is the crip table, where I reflect on my experiences of coming to tables and rooms of disability justice and life affirmation. This was a wide range of things but I just touch upon some workshops by M.E.L.T. called Rest Assured that I attended, as well as a day-ong symposium by Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. In both of these experiences I reflect on how being in touch with both their practices of access and capacities for people's needs induced a sense making of guilt. With this I realised that this feeling of guilt came from the lack of these capacities that I had in myself but also in the relations I had in reach at that time. This sense making also oriented me to know, feel and figure out what sort of access, affirmation and change I wanted to orient towards within my collective social and technical practices.I poetically sum up this chapter, aiming to bring these tables I am in touch withwith those in theory and giving a material background of these crip-tics that will be flipped. This is also left open to make room for them and this research to be disoriented by both the reader's own situated experiences, as well as those of the community and relational tables I approach throughout the rest of this research. These two first chapters make aim to offer up a bed for this research to then lay its disobedient methodology comfortably atop of. With this making room for a methodology that question the capacities, scales and actions I can make room for with these crip politics and access knowledges in practice\n01.02.03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_entries/04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</a> covers my methodology for the research where I define my Disobedient Action Research approach which is the methodology I enacted to feel out the Configure-Able methods mentioned earlier. Disobedient Action Research stems from Action Research (AR), which is a type of research that centres practitioners as knowledge creators through doing, making and being in relation to the material world. Disobedient AR specifically emerges from a type of AR called First Person AR, which Judi Marsh established with her notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty &amp; Marshall, 2021; Marshall, 1999, 2004). Living Life as Inquiry and First Person AR orient to situate themselves further within the role of the practitioner as a knowledge maker. It does this by making room for the practitioner to bring their background, context and embodied feelings into their research practice (otherwise known as their first person perspective). This offers a type of research where we have the capacity to acknowledge where the research is coming from contextually and relationally, as well as emotionally.Disobedient Action Research, which TITiPI as well as Possible Bodies (Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021; TITiPI, Ango, and Lepage 2022) established, in some ways extends this orientation, but in other ways troubles it. Disobedient Action Reseach extends it through making room for us to do First Person Action Research interdependently. This moves the knowledge making process from being within the self, to in between the collective embodied selves. Disobedient Action Research also troubles First Person Action Research by making demands of direct action and change. Even though First Person AR calls for \"change agents\", it is Disobedient AR that orients to question the limits change agents can make. Specifically in the context of computer science and open source software community Possible Bodies ask questions like what of the big issues we feel around computing can actually be broken down and squeezed like (code) bugs? And how can we give feedback and get feedback from places where it is purposefully lacking?I chose to use Disobedient Action Research as it aligns well with my existing practice as a creative developer and community practitioner. It also makes ample room for my context of being a crip researcher, one where I question the scales and limits of politics and their relations. In this it questions what participating within their defined limits offers us, and for us to inquire into how to make change around, within and to those limits. Disobedient AR also makes room for me to work with the collectives and communities that I do, and to try to feel out our collective, local and embodied refusal of Big Tech. Disobedient AR as a methodology in practice also made room for me to develop my own Configure-Able methods, which is what I go on to emerge throughout the rest of this thesis.\n01.02.04_Configure-able_methods<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> is one of the first actions of manifesting through inquiry within this thesis. In it I start to lay down the foundational inquiries into Configure-Able methods by cripping Science and Technology Studies (STS) methods. I start by forming an accessible genealogy of configuration working with Celia Lury et al.'s chapter on Figure, Figuring and Configuration (2022). This genealogy moves from figures as abstract stories, roles and statistics, that we imagine and represent society through, to configuring how these figured plans and stories are brought into material action. I specifically highlight the work of Lucy Suchman's Configuration (2012) as it is both an accessible and quality discussion of a feminist approach to configuration. I particularly take her up as in her essay works with configuration to critique the data management and organisational infrastructure projects of medical care institutions, their supporting politics, and the development of their future care infrastructures.<br>With this genealogy and with Suchman's (ibid) example I inquire into how configuration can be disoriented when put in touch with crip theory? What practices and capacities does a crip Configuration give room for? To do this, I initially set up a framing with Aimi Hamraie's critique of the figure of the user within disability design history and its roots within eugenic industrial design logics that reinforce and shape soft bodies to hard systems. With Hamraie's critique I orient to question how I can challenge the role of the user by distributing the expertise through collective interdependent inquiry. To do this moving to practices of access knowledge formed through design frictions. To do this I reflect on a workshop I ran with NEoN digital<a data-footref=\"q8\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-a9b6937f5595f992_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> in Dundee who are a community based organisation focusing on digital access. These workshops in themselves oriented network accessibility, collective action and Feminist server practices. My inquiry approaches these workshops through a first person reflection and focus on my experiences of configuring access for the first time for an event like this, and how I tried to do this (where possible) through interdependent joy, and impact centred care. In this inquiry reflecting on how distributing the role of the expert within my collaborative group made room for us to challenge the capacity of configuration as access making. In this move disorienting the centralised and prescribed plans of normative configuration through the points of friction and impact we felt as a group together.I then return to Suchman's Configuration (2012) to bring it into contact with this inquiry and these experiences. I do this by taking up disability in her critique where it has been left abscent and invalid from its own dialogues. By giving feedback as a disabled voice to her analysis of the configuration of medical care systems and their politics I imagine what capacities the people with disability at the site of impact of these systems might want from configuration. Here I try to make room to figure out how to uplift their capacity to communicate their needs, feelings and agency through Configure-Able methods. This again very disobediently poses Configure-Able as a question and a prompt, so I can ask how Configure-Able is this relation, infrastructure and politics? Am I supported by it? Or held in place? And how can my collaborators and I orient around the frictions we feel and make room for them to inform our collective configuration practices. This chapter builds up these methods for the next two sections to work through in practice and situate them to be made knowable within different contexts, collaborations and practices. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://neondigitalarts.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://neondigitalarts.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-a9b6937f5595f992_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 01.02.05_In-configure-ability<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> covers one of the inquiries into situating Configure-Able methods within embedded collective practice. To do this I collaborated with In-grid, a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective I helped to set up in 2020. In this context, I worked with the collective to situate Configure-Able methods within our practices to make room for practices for figuring out how we wanted to organise ourselves and our digital network infrastructure together. In doing this, we also queried how we were organised by the inherited relations of our pre-existing social and technical infrastructures that we came in touch with. To inquire into this with In-grid, I have been working through Disobedient AR to practise how these Configure-Able methods can come into being over a reasonable period of time (2+ years) and within an embedded intersectional community. To reflect on this collaboration organised a focus group, where In-grid members collectively figured out our organisational practises together and reflecting on how we had been impacted by the systemic inflexibilities, and in turn how we had collectivley oriented and flexed (where possible) to refuse these normalised tables and relations, to make room for our own. I follow this up with a first person AR reflections around In-grid's technical knowledge sharing practices, informing the group both with Kelsie Acton's notion of Plain Language (2023) to make room for us to orient from and centre critical access. I also reflect on the work with In-grid to develop the Practising Protocols workshops for 4S/EASST, making room for people to disorient these server practices through their embodied and distributed expertise. I this builds to a key focus on a later iteration of these workshops I ran internaly for In-grid, and playfully named (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This internal workshop emerged a collective table of expertise from which we coalesced In-grid's iteration of the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant 2015), called the Femfester which was published in the first edition of Artist Running Datacentres jounral (Simms et al. 2024).This chapter aims to bring to this research table the many scales that I have been manifesting Configure-Able methods within my collaborations with In-grid. By situating these methods in an intersectional collective practice I offer up how critical access can not only be an extra we add on to our social and technical practices but something that can be orient from and action with. In this disorientation of configuration in action we made room for our plans in action to reverberate from the bodies, figures and relations they were in touch with, making wiggle room for In-grid to exist within, around and beyond the sedimented and inherited limits we impacted by.\n01.02.06_A_Cozier_Configure-Ability<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.00_Intro.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.00_Intro</a> reflects on a second inquiry into Configure-Able methods. In this context I wanted to inquire into how I could start to form a crip centred network practice. To do this I formed the Cozy-Cloud as a server space that was made for and by disabled people. This server acts as wiggle room for collaborators and me to try to configure out what life affirming network infrastructures might be like in action. This inquiry into a configure-able crip cloud is developed through both manifesting cripped technical infrastructure, but also the social relations of interdependent care that not only produced but maintain this crip network infrastructure. In this inquiry I surface two artistic works that share how these localised crip centred manifestations of Configure-Able methods have come into being.The first work explores my manifesting of cozy intentions for the server as I initially made it. These intentions were made by developing a set of sticker and alt text pairs. This work by centring alt texts as medium configure access to the front of their composition to highlight the capacity that access practices already have. These capacities of access in the alt texts both lay in them being able to communicate the images content to wider audiences with sensory differences, but also makes the alt text accessible within reduced internet bandwidth that cannot support images. Through these sticker and alt text pairs I poetically manifest a set of cozy intentions for the Cozy-Cloud to emerge from. Each of these forming their own multi-media non-linear orientation for what this server and infrastructure is intending to make room for and within. These intentions in message orient towards forming network infrastructures that do not rely on imaginaries of infinite growth, weaponized economies and exhaustive relations. They intend to do this by making room for computational practices and network infrastructures that intimately retreat away from their militaristic origins and imaginaries. Alongside these intentions I also manifested the Cozy-Cloud relaxation space for people to be in reach of this crip server infrastructure and its cozy intentions in a relaxing calm environment. To emphasise this multi-sensory/media set of intentions I also made cozy fluffy cushions, a printable easy read version of the cozy intentions and physical versions of the stickers, so that those visiting can interact and feel these intentions in a way that is comfy and accessible to them. In doing this opening up how I can form many ways of communicating these technical relations and my intedned approaches towards them so that people can be in touch with them, and figure them out through their own embodied knowing and expertise.<br>The second work I surface in this chapter is that of the En-crip-ing Time, which was a collaboration with Marianna Marongoni<a data-footref=\"q9\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-98a55565d91165e6_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This work inquired into how to crip both the time and intimacies of the Cozy-Cloud server and its relations to network infrastructures. To do this we configured out our own poetic performance of cron jobs (deterministic and routine maintenance jobs on Unix operating systems) as chronic jobs (indeterminate, indefinite care and maintenance through intimacy). To make room for crip times here we hacked multiple bits of code and syntax to wiggle room within the existing infrastructural limits of network time for our poetic crip times. In this work we also highlight the social aspects of making the infrastructure together, and how to do this we made room for each other, our capacities and our needs so that this crip infrastructure could come into being. I also touch upon the essay that we wrote for Brand-New-Life about the work (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025), and where we try to blur the boundaries, variability and formats of academic texts to both hold technical dialogues, but also the very crip feeling Marianna and I had around them.I conclude the chapter by both reflecting back at these projects and how they have transformed network practices by bring them in touch with crip bodies, tables and politics, but also to orient forward to the futures that the Cozy-Cloud is approaching. This future is one of slowly building up more collaborations and infrastructures to figure out in action what accessible and configure-able crip network practices can be. Whatever may lay in the indeterminate future of the Cozy-Cloud, I know we will orient from critical access today, to make room for life affirming infrastructures of tomorrow. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://marianamarangoni.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://marianamarangoni.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-98a55565d91165e6_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 01.03.00_ConclusionThis thesis and its inquiries go on to shape in action what Configure-able methods can be in these localities. With these inquiries into Configure-able methods in action I ask how can they make room for us to orient from the site of impact within configuration? How can we not only stay with the frictions that disorient our plans but care for the impact we can make around them? And how can we centre crip theory and critical access not only in the ways that we can organise and care for our communities, but the ways this can impact and shape the configurations of these hard systems to orient them toward being the life affirming infrastructures we know we need now!??!?!?!\npandoc_orderinput-files:\n./01.00_Intro.md\n./01.01.00_Background.md\n./01.02.00_Chapters.md\n./01.02.01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\n./01.02.02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\n./01.02.03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\n./01.02.04_Configure-able_methods.md\n./01.02.05_In-configure-ability.md\n./01.02.06_A_Cozier_Configure-Ability.md\n./01.03.00_Conclusion.md\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"01_Introduction_canvas.canvas\" href=\"01_Introduction_canvas.canvas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Configuration</a>","level":1,"id":"[Configuration](01_Introduction_canvas.canvas)_0"},{"heading":"Entries","level":1,"id":"Entries_0"},{"heading":"Introduction","level":7,"id":"Introduction_0"},{"heading":"Background","level":8,"id":"Background_0"},{"heading":"Chapters","level":8,"id":"Chapters_0"},{"heading":"Disability justice and life affirmation flipping the table","level":9,"id":"Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_0"},{"heading":"Crip-tic of Vignettes","level":9,"id":"Crip-tic_of_Vignettes_0"},{"heading":"Disobedient Action Research Cycles","level":9,"id":"Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_0"},{"heading":"Configure-able methods","level":9,"id":"Configure-able_methods_0"},{"heading":"In-configure-ability","level":9,"id":"In-configure-ability_0"},{"heading":"A Cozier Configure-Ability","level":9,"id":"A_Cozier_Configure-Ability_0"},{"heading":"Conclusion","level":8,"id":"Conclusion_0"}],"links":["01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-2-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-3-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-4-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-5-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-2-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-3-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-4-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-5-58c0457a9a1b6c15_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-90ecb6da99c64a34_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-2-90ecb6da99c64a34_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-90ecb6da99c64a34_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-2-90ecb6da99c64a34_0",".html",".html",".html",".html","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-a9b6937f5595f992_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-a9b6937f5595f992_0",".html",".html","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fn-1-98a55565d91165e6_0","01_introduction/01_introduction.html#fnref-1-98a55565d91165e6_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"01_introduction/01_introduction.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.00_intro.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.00_chapters.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.01_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.02_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.03_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.04_configure-able_methods.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.05_in-configure-ability.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.02.06_a_cozier_configure-ability.html","01_introduction/01_entries/01.03.00_conclusion.html","01_introduction/01_entries/pandoc_order.html"],"createdTime":1756048612754,"modifiedTime":1756048612756,"sourceSize":627,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/01_Introduction/01_Introduction.md","exportPath":"01_introduction/01_introduction.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html":{"title":"01_Introduction_canvas","icon":"","description":"Chapter overviewsThis thesis brings to the table my research into and practices of Configure-Able methods. These Configure-Able methods have emerged through my researches transdisciplinary approach, which brings together Queer Feminism, crip theory and Science and Technology Studies (STS). With this research approach I inquire around how to form wiggle room within the inherited norms of network and organisational infrastructures when configuring them out locally with communities. In this context I collaborated with a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective In-grid<a data-footref=\"y1\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-1-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and the initiation of a crip centred server space called the Cozy-Cloud<a data-footref=\"y2\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-2-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. With this question of \"is it Configure-Able?\" I inquired with them into how our communities, digital art collectives and crip servers can manifest their social and technical infrastructures to fit around our capacities, bodies and needs. In these inquiries we found friction with the determined roles, relations and matters we rubbed up against or were forced into. Here we orientedto trying to put our communities and their organisation/network configuring practices in touch with each other by distributing expertise through critical access, so that they can mutually affect the capacities, limits and horizons of each other. With my inquiries this has both oriented the configuration of network infrastructures and organisation practices to be more accessible to collective practices and dialogues, but also for these infrastructuring and organising practices themselves to be figured out by community impacted by them. This is where my work with critical access and crip theory disorients this research's approach and demands not for extra time or room around the inherited norm, but for community, interdependence and impact centred practices to become an indeterminate norm that we centre on when approaching configuring our collective infrastructures.<br>Configure-Able methods in this research makes wiggle room with communities by disorienting the figures of their social and technical configurations. Figures are the roles<a data-footref=\"y3\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-3-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, stories<a data-footref=\"y4\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-4-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and metaphors<a data-footref=\"y5\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-5-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> that orient and lay out the plans that go on to be configured into infrastructures. So when, with Configure-able methods in my collaborations, when we start to disorient their figures from the ground up, such as users as carer, servers as collaborators and security as safety through intimacy the plans and their configurations drastically change. This is especially emphasised in my turn to radical disability politics of crip theory and its disobedience that goes beyond the talking about frictions we have with the figures and politics, to reorient to making friction through direct action and configuring out our own local improvisation together where possible. This direct action in my collaborative inquiries have even been simple things like admitting our collective orientation and ethics is out of reach for now. In this acknowledgement though, is a figuring out together what we do want and how to wiggle towards the room this needs together. These actions have also been more material movements such as collectively manifesting In-grid's first server infrastructure, as well as forming a ccrip centred server called the Cozy-Cloud. Through these inquiries and reflections I aim to offer up forms and capacities that these Configure-Able methodology not only enact, but demand!Later on in this chapter I go through a closer reading of the thesis and give an overview of each chapter to orient them to be more accessible. Next though I go through figuring the background of this research, which is a recurring move in this thesis. Bringing focus to the background gives room, contour and shape for figures and bodies to emerge from. In this initial background I give a short introduction to why my research and practice disobediently oriented towards the emergence of Configure-able methods through collective and community centred organisation and infrastructuring. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-1-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://cozy-cloud.net/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-2-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>User, Designer, Server, Client, Expert<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-3-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Of zero trust internet networks, security as privacy and centralised control as achievable.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-4-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Secure Shell (SSH) handshakes, firewalls and chronic jobs.<a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-5-022d7230f1da9bd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n01.00_Intro<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_entries/04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</a> covers my methodology for the research where I define my Disobedient Action Research approach which is the methodology I enacted to feel out the Configure-Able methods mentioned earlier. Disobedient Action Research stems from Action Research (AR), which is a type of research that centres practitioners as knowledge creators through doing, making and being in relation to the material world. Disobedient AR specifically emerges from a type of AR called First Person AR, which Judi Marsh established with her notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty &amp; Marshall, 2021; Marshall, 1999, 2004). Living Life as Inquiry and First Person AR orient to situate themselves further within the role of the practitioner as a knowledge maker. It does this by making room for the practitioner to bring their background, context and embodied feelings into their research practice (otherwise known as their first person perspective). This offers a type of research where we have the capacity to acknowledge where the research is coming from contextually and relationally, as well as emotionally.Disobedient Action Research, which TITiPI as well as Possible Bodies (Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021; TITiPI, Ango, and Lepage 2022) established, in some ways extends this orientation, but in other ways troubles it. Disobedient Action Reseach extends it through making room for us to do First Person Action Research interdependently. This moves the knowledge making process from being within the self, to in between the collective embodied selves. Disobedient Action Research also troubles First Person Action Research by making demands of direct action and change. Even though First Person AR calls for \"change agents\", it is Disobedient AR that orients to question the limits change agents can make. Specifically in the context of computer science and open source software community Possible Bodies ask questions like what of the big issues we feel around computing can actually be broken down and squeezed like (code) bugs? And how can we give feedback and get feedback from places where it is purposefully lacking?I chose to use Disobedient Action Research as it aligns well with my existing practice as a creative developer and community practitioner. It also makes ample room for my context of being a crip researcher, one where I question the scales and limits of politics and their relations. In this it questions what participating within their defined limits offers us, and for us to inquire into how to make change around, within and to those limits. Disobedient AR also makes room for me to work with the collectives and communities that I do, and to try to feel out our collective, local and embodied refusal of Big Tech. Disobedient AR as a methodology in practice also made room for me to develop my own Configure-Able methods, which is what I go on to emerge throughout the rest of this thesis.01.02.03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles05_Configure-able methods_canvas.canvas<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> accompanies the last one as a way to bring in the embodied feelings and knowledges of the ableist relations that I theoretically explained in the last chapter but have also experienced during my PhD and wider work. I do this as it is important for my research around disability to be situated at my table and contextualised from the experiences I have had. This chapter aims to bring in much of the background and labour that is often negated or hidden from view of the research table. It refuses to hide these Queer and crip relations, but also to acknowledge my bodily horizon as a gender queer disabled white middle class person, and make that experience and context somewhat knowable in this research.The crip-tic itself plays on the fractal scales of a tic or stim that is discussed in Get The Frac In! (Maier et al. 2020), unpredictable, indefinite and recursive. This also plays with the scales of Tych (diptych, triptych, etc.) in painting, where different paintings are held together in indeterminate compositions. I work with this composition of a crip-tic to offer up insights into some of the bodies I have come into contact with during this research. The crip-tic also aims to be left open to further Tics and indeterminate instances of crip experience that go well out of my reach and make room for the readers to add their own context. The very crip tics that I surface here are a number of tables and normalised relations I have encountered within the UK institutional context where I am based, and which I go through below.The first table I come to is the Research Table(chap), where I reflect on the frictions I felt when I was taken up as a crip research object by an emerging X Digital Futures Institute. Here I highlight the ways these researchers, and the norms of research they were operating with, made no room for intimacy with the radial politics and practices of crip studies, and in practice infantilised and undermined the possibilities of these politics in action. In reflecting on these frictions I aim to flip the table on how this research table, like many before it, does not have the capacity for, and is not yet in reach of the sorts of radical intimacy and access that crip practices demand.I then go on to feel out the second table of the Computing Table (chap), where I reflect on being in relation to the ex-cell table of institutions. Here I orient it through both being an access and care requester towards my own medical needs, as well as being a teacher and care giver within institutions. Both of these orientations reflect on a computing table that is configured to not make room for people's voices or needs. These tables are instead oriented to extract specific figures and data from people to hold them in place in their determined ex-cell.The third crip-tic orients my most recent experiences of the Operating Table (chap) and institutional medical model of care. This tic reflects on how I was treated when I had a flair up with my health condition and tried to get care from these institutions. It offers up an insight into the sick crip times that are currently operated by these institutions in the UK and how they are nowhere near in reach of offering me (or others) the care I knew I needed. This inquiry and encounter was a reminder that we are often left off worse by the operations and treatments normalised by these tables of institutional \"care\". This reflection aims to highlight how the medical model exists in my experience and contextualises it to the current UK political climate of living in the aftermath of austerity cuts to social care.The final table I come to is the crip table, where I reflect on my experiences of coming to tables and rooms of disability justice and life affirmation. This was a wide range of things but I just touch upon some workshops by M.E.L.T. called Rest Assured that I attended, as well as a day-ong symposium by Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. In both of these experiences I reflect on how being in touch with both their practices of access and capacities for people's needs induced a sense making of guilt. With this I realised that this feeling of guilt came from the lack of these capacities that I had in myself but also in the relations I had in reach at that time. This sense making also oriented me to know, feel and figure out what sort of access, affirmation and change I wanted to orient towards within my collective social and technical practices.I poetically sum up this chapter, aiming to bring these tables I am in touch withwith those in theory and giving a material background of these crip-tics that will be flipped. This is also left open to make room for them and this research to be disoriented by both the reader's own situated experiences, as well as those of the community and relational tables I approach throughout the rest of this research. These two first chapters make aim to offer up a bed for this research to then lay its disobedient methodology comfortably atop of. With this making room for a methodology that question the capacities, scales and actions I can make room for with these crip politics and access knowledges in practice01.02.02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.canvas<br>In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> I form the critical framing of my research. The fields I work across here are Queer Feminism, crip theory, and Feminist STS. I initially align with Sarah Ahmed's Queer Phenomenology (2006) to think through her concepts of orientation, sedimentation and the bodily horizon. I do this to think around what is in reach, and how inherited relations can orient me so that my contingent (other queer) desires are out of reach. I also surface her soft body and the ways it make room for me to think about the impressions I make on others (and them on me) and the technologies we stay in touch with. With Kafer's concepts I aim to highlight the situated ways of approaching technologies through social relations, as well as the capacity to mutually affect and transform them and the ways I practice them through radical Queer and crip politics.I then orient closely to crip theory to feel out the radical politics that I want to put in touch with these bodies of technoscience, network infrastructuring and collective organising. To do this I take up a reading of Alison Kafer's Feminist, Queer and crip, (2013) among other works, to emerge my own understanding of her Political/Relational Model, crip time, and a crip intersectionality. With these I highlight an understanding of crip theory as a place that has the capacity to disorient our inherited and normalised organisation and networking practices through the radical capacities of interdependence, care and critical access. With Kafer I also take up a close reading of her figure of the disabled body in technology, or the cyborg, stepping out of line to be a situated body and horizon to map and configure technologies on their own terms.With Kafer's later Manifesting Manifestos (2023) and her Health Rebels (2017) talk, I bring about the crip manifesto and manifestings as a practice and framing for this research. As Kafer describes it, how can we form a crazed practice of crip manifestos, each imperfection, flaw and friction offering each iteration orientation towards a future crips need and desire now. Here I also touch on Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) to orient this crazed crip manifesting towards STS and to inquire more closely into the social and technical practices of infrastructures. Their manifesto importantly for this work offering up how friction is felt and made felt by others through the direct action of crip technoscience. With them I take this up in my research to ask how we can centre the knowledge of people at the sites of impact within the infrastructures that not only support their communities but affirm their lives.With this chapter I aim to offer up this approach of a crazed crip manifesting of manifestos as a way to orient my research away from the inherited and sedimented norms of collective infrastructures. Through these practices of manifesting disorientations I aim to bring in reach a practice of community network infrastructuring that draws from crip Theory and a version of STS that is sensitive to the inaccessibility of roles, language and politics that science and technology normalise.01.02.01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_tableIn this section I will give an overview of the chapters that make up this thesis.01.02.00_ChaptersIn a way this background to the research is so far away and so small on its metaphorical horizon that it only takes up this small section of the introduction. I still find it important to mention these now distant inquiries as it offers many of the reasons for why these Configure-able methods, my collaborative inquiries and this thesis have come into being. Coming into this PhD I was very much following the norms of computer science, and even though I had been tought to code creatively I had still been taught how to optimise code, automate decisions and of course train AI models to make them for me. With this sedimented norm in place, even though I was fairly set on collective knowledge creation, I of course started by making many different bits of code, databases, and critiques of how AI might do things with us or for us.<br>As I proceeded in this inherited practise and normalised path I started to read up and relate more to crip theory and its critiques of technology. One of these critiques that surfaced was of AI and computations histories and practices that originate from those of eugenics. Eugenics as a phony science believes that we can shape and cure the human race of unwanted and feeble minded individuals through genetic selection, and has a long history of violence toward disabled people and many other marginalised groups. Wendy Chun in here book Discriminating Data (2021) covers how these algorithms work on both mathematics and social levels through not only these eugenic logics, but also segregationist algorithms that split people into groups via different physical and social \"features\". Timnit Gebru and Émile Torres in their essay \"The TESCREAL bundle\" (2024), and as part of D.A.I.R.<a data-footref=\"y6\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-1-0d86b59c38645414_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, also bring together current histories of how eugenic genetic curing have also been accelerated into silicon valley transhumanist imaginaries that cure humanity of our feeble and disposable bodies as a way to reach a \"net good\". To find this cure they are of course gambling everything on the yet out of reach Artificial Generalised Intelligence (AGI) and its unknown and often undeclared capabilities. Johannes Bruder in his chapter AI as medium and message (2023, 171) where he discuses how the imaginaries of AI both fetishise and want to cure Autistic and neurodiverse individuals in particular.Later on in the flipping table (chap) I go on to talk more closely about crip takes on technology, and Alison Kafer's (Kafer 2013) crip critique of transhumanism, and this crip refusal of the imaginary and need to cure people through these ever unferling and never in reach speculative future technologies. In response Kafer offers a refusal of a future cure to instead to orient to what is in reach. In changing this focus, Kafer is asking how can communities form social and technologies politics and relations that can manifest the care and affirmative infrastructures now?When inquiring through practise with AI, I developed a number of different speculative works to reflect through what was in reach of me with AI. These ranged from situated community made datasets that questioned the normalisation and isolation of indexes, as well as interactive bits of code that made accessible how AI algorithms segment space. The type of AI that I particularly oriented towards though and got to know through practice was that of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This was partially due to deepminds work with \"mastering\" Go and other closed system games (Silver et al. 2016; 2017), and as this made room to hype up to be the part of RL/AI that could encounter new things, the unknown, or be \"creative\". It was also because it could be used to train multi-agent environments and I wanted to explore how to form environments of collaboration and organisation within these terms. I went on to form works with RL, with the main one trying to configure these \"agents\" so that the group of them could communicate to one another through abstract patterns and emerge their own visual language and representation of their environment together. These came out okay, but I ended up desisting from working with them for a few reasons. The main one was after a while I realised that the logics of the RL algorithm that was supposed to enable AI to encounter the unknown, and within AGI imaginaries cure every yet unknown problem, was in simple a penal logic. This meant that the only feedback was to punish or reward the agent to reinforce it to form a \"policy\" for that environments task. It was also well noted to only work well in time sensitive environments if you keep giving a constant punishment to the agents at every step. In practice this system was very uncreative, the agent was mostly not understanding what you wanted it to do and always trying to trick the rules you laid out to just get the max points. When working in this relationship especially it I tried to figure out a relation and dynamic where I did not have to \"master\" or train them to get them to learn anything. Another reason is that I felt that a lot of this practice that I had done was very closed off and hard to collaborate with others through. Here I realised that for me to use AI critically and sustainably in any of my local community contexts was fairly far out of my reach at the time. None of this made this technology either accessible or desirable to me after a while. I slowly stopped to work with these AI agents in the end, as there seemed no way to collaborate with them without executing, mastering or punishing them, and the agents always seemed to want to run away or escape when we came into contact under these terms.<br>Another more direct explanation of this is again from D.A.I.R., but this time from an episode of the Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000 podcast by linguist Prof.&nbsp;Emily M. Bender and sociologist Dr.&nbsp;Alex Hanna. In this podcast they often playfully take apart AI papers and their critical underpinning. I bring this podcast up though as I want to focus on Bender's critique of LLM's in the Can Machines Learn To Behave? Part 3 (Hanna and Bender 2022). As she puts it<a data-footref=\"y7\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-2-0d86b59c38645414_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, there are so many ways of modelling language that exist, and yet they try to fit it all through this one single algorithm that is based on eugenics, not overule any prior histories and practices of language or linguistics. In a similar orientation I realised that yes I might be able to organise with my community through AI and to fold up our issues into abstract eugenics logics to automate our decisions, but in doing this we lose the capacity and room to emerge the many other logics and algorithms that we can interdependently and locally manifest ourselves together from our divergent backgrounds. So as I disorient away from this background of a cured future through automation I ask how with the collaborations of this thesis I can make space for us to move beyond these normalising practises of computing that prescribed generalised logics of organisation onto our community? Through this thesis' research and its inquiries I felt out these Configure-Able methods as a way to form a response to this question and inquire into how communities can come together to configure out their social and technical infrastructures and politics locally.Just to be clear this is not a total refusal of AI or to say that algorithms are defined by their origins. It is instead to acknowledge these histories and the limits of their logics when we do work with them. With this crip relation to technology, it is to be okay with technologies messiness, but to actively take care around/within their limits. For instance in my inquiries, it is to be okay with the AI speech to text algorithm that we have for now, but to both orient towards community driven and joyous live captions Like I did in my inquiries, but also to centres stenographer/transcription knowledges within automated captioning technologies like Louise Hickman's cripping of AI (Louise Hickman 2021). For Laura Forlano as well, is to be okay with the automated AI insulin pen (2023) and it's buggines, but in this to again centre points of impact and the person's embodied experience to these technologies in our critique of them. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.dair-institute.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.dair-institute.org/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-1-0d86b59c38645414_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Um but also then he goes on to say \"Real insight began to emerge with word2vec\" which is one of these first sort of neural approaches to language modeling.

In this context I wanted to inquire into how I could start to form a crip centred network practice. To do this I formed the Cozy-Cloud as a server space that was made for and by disabled people. This server acts as wiggle room for collaborators and me to try to configure out what life affirming network infrastructures might be like in action. This inquiry into a configure-able crip cloud is developed through both manifesting cripped technical infrastructure, but also the social relations of interdependent care that not only produced but maintain this crip network infrastructure. In this inquiry I surface two artistic works that share how these localised crip centred manifestations of Configure-Able methods have come into being.The first work explores my manifesting of cozy intentions for the server as I initially made it. These intentions were made by developing a set of sticker and alt text pairs. This work by centring alt texts as medium configure access to the front of their composition to highlight the capacity that access practices already have. These capacities of access in the alt texts both lay in them being able to communicate the images content to wider audiences with sensory differences, but also makes the alt text accessible within reduced internet bandwidth that cannot support images. Through these sticker and alt text pairs I poetically manifest a set of cozy intentions for the Cozy-Cloud to emerge from. Each of these forming their own multi-media non-linear orientation for what this server and infrastructure is intending to make room for and within. These intentions in message orient towards forming network infrastructures that do not rely on imaginaries of infinite growth, weaponized economies and exhaustive relations. They intend to do this by making room for computational practices and network infrastructures that intimately retreat away from their militaristic origins and imaginaries. Alongside these intentions I also manifested the Cozy-Cloud relaxation space for people to be in reach of this crip server infrastructure and its cozy intentions in a relaxing calm environment. To emphasise this multi-sensory/media set of intentions I also made cozy fluffy cushions, a printable easy read version of the cozy intentions and physical versions of the stickers, so that those visiting can interact and feel these intentions in a way that is comfy and accessible to them. In doing this opening up how I can form many ways of communicating these technical relations and my intedned approaches towards them so that people can be in touch with them, and figure them out through their own embodied knowing and expertise.<br>The second work I surface in this chapter is that of the En-crip-ing Time, which was a collaboration with Marianna Marongoni<a data-footref=\"q9\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-1-37c457187f4542a4_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This work inquired into how to crip both the time and intimacies of the Cozy-Cloud server and its relations to network infrastructures. To do this we configured out our own poetic performance of cron jobs (deterministic and routine maintenance jobs on Unix operating systems) as chronic jobs (indeterminate, indefinite care and maintenance through intimacy). To make room for crip times here we hacked multiple bits of code and syntax to wiggle room within the existing infrastructural limits of network time for our poetic crip times. In this work we also highlight the social aspects of making the infrastructure together, and how to do this we made room for each other, our capacities and our needs so that this crip infrastructure could come into being. I also touch upon the essay that we wrote for Brand-New-Life about the work (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025), and where we try to blur the boundaries, variability and formats of academic texts to both hold technical dialogues, but also the very crip feeling Marianna and I had around them.I conclude the chapter by both reflecting back at these projects and how they have transformed network practices by bring them in touch with crip bodies, tables and politics, but also to orient forward to the futures that the Cozy-Cloud is approaching. This future is one of slowly building up more collaborations and infrastructures to figure out in action what accessible and configure-able crip network practices can be. Whatever may lay in the indeterminate future of the Cozy-Cloud, I know we will orient from critical access today, to make room for life affirming infrastructures of tomorrow. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://marianamarangoni.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://marianamarangoni.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-1-37c457187f4542a4_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n01.02.06_A_Cozier_Configure-Ability<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> covers one of the inquiries into situating Configure-Able methods within embedded collective practice. To do this I collaborated with In-grid, a Trans*Feminist digital arts collective I helped to set up in 2020. In this context, I worked with the collective to situate Configure-Able methods within our practices to make room for practices for figuring out how we wanted to organise ourselves and our digital network infrastructure together. In doing this, we also queried how we were organised by the inherited relations of our pre-existing social and technical infrastructures that we came in touch with. To inquire into this with In-grid, I have been working through Disobedient AR to practise how these Configure-Able methods can come into being over a reasonable period of time (2+ years) and within an embedded intersectional community. To reflect on this collaboration organised a focus group, where In-grid members collectively figured out our organisational practises together and reflecting on how we had been impacted by the systemic inflexibilities, and in turn how we had collectivley oriented and flexed (where possible) to refuse these normalised tables and relations, to make room for our own. I follow this up with a first person AR reflections around In-grid's technical knowledge sharing practices, informing the group both with Kelsie Acton's notion of Plain Language (2023) to make room for us to orient from and centre critical access. I also reflect on the work with In-grid to develop the Practising Protocols workshops for 4S/EASST, making room for people to disorient these server practices through their embodied and distributed expertise. I this builds to a key focus on a later iteration of these workshops I ran internaly for In-grid, and playfully named (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This internal workshop emerged a collective table of expertise from which we coalesced In-grid's iteration of the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant 2015), called the Femfester which was published in the first edition of Artist Running Datacentres jounral (Simms et al. 2024).This chapter aims to bring to this research table the many scales that I have been manifesting Configure-Able methods within my collaborations with In-grid. By situating these methods in an intersectional collective practice I offer up how critical access can not only be an extra we add on to our social and technical practices but something that can be orient from and action with. In this disorientation of configuration in action we made room for our plans in action to reverberate from the bodies, figures and relations they were in touch with, making wiggle room for In-grid to exist within, around and beyond the sedimented and inherited limits we impacted by.01.02.05_In-configure-ability<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> is one of the first actions of manifesting through inquiry within this thesis. In it I start to lay down the foundational inquiries into Configure-Able methods by cripping Science and Technology Studies (STS) methods. I start by forming an accessible genealogy of configuration working with Celia Lury et al.'s chapter on Figure, Figuring and Configuration (2022). This genealogy moves from figures as abstract stories, roles and statistics, that we imagine and represent society through, to configuring how these figured plans and stories are brought into material action. I specifically highlight the work of Lucy Suchman's Configuration (2012) as it is both an accessible and quality discussion of a feminist approach to configuration. I particularly take her up as in her essay works with configuration to critique the data management and organisational infrastructure projects of medical care institutions, their supporting politics, and the development of their future care infrastructures.<br>With this genealogy and with Suchman's (ibid) example I inquire into how configuration can be disoriented when put in touch with crip theory? What practices and capacities does a crip Configuration give room for? To do this, I initially set up a framing with Aimi Hamraie's critique of the figure of the user within disability design history and its roots within eugenic industrial design logics that reinforce and shape soft bodies to hard systems. With Hamraie's critique I orient to question how I can challenge the role of the user by distributing the expertise through collective interdependent inquiry. To do this moving to practices of access knowledge formed through design frictions. To do this I reflect on a workshop I ran with NEoN digital<a data-footref=\"q8\" href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fn-1-62c8c9c9882fbbd3_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> in Dundee who are a community based organisation focusing on digital access. These workshops in themselves oriented network accessibility, collective action and Feminist server practices. My inquiry approaches these workshops through a first person reflection and focus on my experiences of configuring access for the first time for an event like this, and how I tried to do this (where possible) through interdependent joy, and impact centred care. In this inquiry reflecting on how distributing the role of the expert within my collaborative group made room for us to challenge the capacity of configuration as access making. In this move disorienting the centralised and prescribed plans of normative configuration through the points of friction and impact we felt as a group together.I then return to Suchman's Configuration (2012) to bring it into contact with this inquiry and these experiences. I do this by taking up disability in her critique where it has been left abscent and invalid from its own dialogues. By giving feedback as a disabled voice to her analysis of the configuration of medical care systems and their politics I imagine what capacities the people with disability at the site of impact of these systems might want from configuration. Here I try to make room to figure out how to uplift their capacity to communicate their needs, feelings and agency through Configure-Able methods. This again very disobediently poses Configure-Able as a question and a prompt, so I can ask how Configure-Able is this relation, infrastructure and politics? Am I supported by it? Or held in place? And how can my collaborators and I orient around the frictions we feel and make room for them to inform our collective configuration practices. This chapter builds up these methods for the next two sections to work through in practice and situate them to be made knowable within different contexts, collaborations and practices. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://neondigitalarts.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://neondigitalarts.com/</a><a href=\"01_introduction/01_introduction_canvas.html#fnref-1-62c8c9c9882fbbd3_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n01.02.04_Configure-able_methodsThis thesis and its inquiries go on to shape in action what Configure-able methods can be in these localities.

How can we not only stay with the frictions that disorient our plans but care for the impact we can make around them? And how can we centre crip theory and critical access not only in the ways that we can organise and care for our communities, but the ways this can impact and shape the configurations of these hard

is the time for me to try and approach a crip table. This chapter makes present how this work approaches this crip table and axis and inquire into analyse the institutional tables I am engaged in as a disabled practitioner and researcher. It gives some depth to why these tables have been impossible for me to approach as a crip, let alone get a grip on. This isn't because the physical institutional setup have barriers that stops me from accessing them, nor does my chronic health often debilitate me, and fortunately my care system somewhat validates my disability<a data-footref=\"x1\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Nor is it that I am incapable of doing \"quality\" research. It is because of the political/relations of these institutions that burn me (out) every time I am in touch with them. It is because when I come to these tables they cut away at my capacities. Here, as I will go on to discuss further, I am thinking with Ahmed's notation of sedimentation and the determined orientations of work that result in repetitive strain injury (RSI) from bodies being held in place, and which reinforce work to break them before they start.<br>When I come to these institutional tables I am neither willing nor able to follow these exhaustive straight paths they set, as with my fatigue I will need a nap on route, maybe make a stew, go for a walk to digest and take a bath to replenish and care for my bodymind. By the time I am ready and able, the path has often grown over, or I might have forgotten exactly what I was doing or where I am (going)<a data-footref=\"x2\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These crip lines are deviating orientations of survival and of life affirmation. What does it mean to be able to lay with these very queer and crip paths? Where can we hold this crip stuff and make times that celebrate them as places of generative access in conversation, instead of invalidating, problematising and backgrounding them from the tables where they have always been present but \"hidden from view\"?Through discussing these backgrounds this chapter acts as the positioning statement of the research. It aims to contextualise the research within queer and crip theory, specifically Sara Ahmed's work (2006) on Queer Phenomenology; Alison Kafer's work (2013; 2017; 2021; 2023) on crip time, her political/relational model of disability, and her crazed crip manifestings. I also orient this towards my focus of technoscience with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Manifesto (2019), Hamraie's wider work of access friction and access knowledge. This framework is used throughout the thesis to not only frame the analysis but also situate the work from my experiences of institutional relations to access, computing and care as a crip &amp; trans teacher, coder, collective instigator and researcher. Following Sara Ahmed I aim to offer an approach to how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (2006), specifically how this shaping takes place when approaching accessible futures for crip and disabled folks at the institutional tables of research, computing and collective practice. Building from Ahmed's figure and framework of the table as an \"orientation device\" this chapter asks what are these tables I am approaching, and why do I (often) retreat instead of taking a seat? It makes room to question what the normative and inherited political/relations of these institutional tables are, and how crip as method and situated experience, practice and knowledges makes room for us to imagine, coalesce, disorient and manifest other collective tables into being.<br>This framework held in parallel with the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> chapter, forms an orientation for this research that proposes crip manifestings, manifestos, protocols and infrastructures as a way to re-orient the norms of computational practices through a cripping disorientation. This disorientation asking us to refuse the pull, the heckles and obligations of tech practices and to listen to our own crip and queer axes, ones of life affirmation and radical relational politics, to form our own deviating lines that fit our collective and community bodily horizons instead of cutting away at them. This thesis draws other lines of survival, of necessity and of crip movement making, where we refuse orientations of tables and relations that aim to break bodies before they begin. Instead, it seeks to form practices to manifest together orientations and movements that can turn these tables towards stories of collective liberation and care. <br>As some disabilities are invalidated, or indeterminate within medicine, often leading to some of the most exhausting and painful experiences, that are still somehow invalidated.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>No matter who I am.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fnref-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disability justice and life affirmation flipping the table","level":1,"id":"Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_0"}],"links":["02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0",".html","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html#fnref-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612761,"modifiedTime":1756048612761,"sourceSize":4799,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_Intro.md","exportPath":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.00_intro.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.00_orienting_the_table.html":{"title":"02.01.00_Orienting_the_table","icon":"","description":"In Ahmed's Queer Phenenology, she keenly defines orientation<a data-footref=\"13\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.00_orienting_the_table.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> as a way to situate the dialogue of direction. This move changes the scoping from a generalised and centralised dictation of direction that wider modernist philosophy denotes, to a situated and relational navigation of bodies. She does this by queering Husserl's figure of a table, his orientation towards it and his knowing of what is behind him as he does so (Ibid, 29). To do this she positions his back, and backgrounding of things, as the point of deviation that a queer phenomenology takes up in its analysis. At this inversion of direction and position sits the ability to wonder what is behind, to meander and imagine otherwise. Ahmed calls this \"turning the tables\"<a data-footref=\"14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.00_orienting_the_table.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, where we situate a table by letting its background sink in and by caring for the work and maintenance that is often ''hidden from view\"(Ibid, 63) to make room for these queer, crip, social and domestic tables to be generative discourses within research and knowledge creation. This is where tables become many, where they deviate from straight standardised and projected 'known' formulas and become complex assemblages, with histories, sedimentations and horizons.<br>The \"bodily horizon\"(Ibid, 55) is key to understanding Ahmed's figure, as it asks, what do we orient ourselves towards? What do we bring towards ourselves from our horizon, and what objects do we let slip from view and out of reach? When we acknowledge we have limits to our perception, that we cannot see the whole environment, image or figure, we must be in a context. Ahmed's horizon queers phenomenology's horizon and encourages us to consider our own orientation, situate ourselves within our bodily horizon of social and domestic relations and ask which orientations of space make our bodies feel out of place. With Nirmal Puwar's 'Space Invaders', Ahmed shows how non-white bodies in places oriented for white bodies makes them feel \"out of place\" (Ibid, 133). She says that these bodies are disoriented by the society and people around them: \"people blink and then look again\" (Ibid, 135). For her this disorientation is a queer slanting of space, disorientations of bodies and that of bodies into objects. Ahmed poses disorientation<a data-footref=\"15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.00_orienting_the_table.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as the point of failure, in which a body is placed into a form with which they do not fit, where they are objectified, and their needs are held out of reach.When we \"feel out of place\" and disorientation is the norm, Ahmed poses the movement of being in retreat, of moving away from, whilst facing. In this retreat, she says, there is queer joy as we look back at a past fading, into a future which can make room for \"the condition of possibility for another way of dwelling in the world\" (Ibid, 178). In feeling out of place at, disoriented by and in retreat from institutional tables this research(er) asks what it means to move within reach of another way of dwelling at these tables of computation, collaboration and institution, and specifically one that cares for and affirms crip and queer lives, experiences and knowledges. <br>\"Adding ''orientation'' to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position.\" (Ahmed 2006, 12)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.00_orienting_the_table.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"In a way, a queer phenomenology is involved in the project of ''turning the tables'' on phenomenology by turning toward other kinds of tables.

She makes an analogy here with a lump on her finger from where she grips her pen, where her finger has built up and sedimented its form in relation to the pen. Ahmed sums it up simply as \"what we ''do do'' affects what we ''can do.''\" (Ibid, 59). She refuses the hegemonic causality of a focus on doing as a singular straight direction. Instead, she suggests orientation is an expanding of a certain direction, that may relationally restrict others, but is not determinative. Her definition makes it possible for orientations and their sedimentations to not be singular in focus, and to make room form them to be navigated and approached within complex relations on our horizons and to take queer paths between them. When this approach arrives at the regressive mono-logics of institutional efficiencies, it disobediently opens up the many other paths and directions that are contingent.Ahmed also discusses RSI as a potential effect of inheritance, sedimentation, time, repetition, and the determined table. RSI is the strain and pain caused from bodies repetitively conforming to a tables that does not care for them and figures them to be disabled before they begin. Here, bent over, hunched and aching as I work, in this cramped spot, is the perfect time to stretch out into Ahmed's queering of orientation. With RSI, I overtly feel how my body wants to be orientated<a data-footref=\"16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.01_sedimentation.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, but I am contorted by inflexible hard systems, infrastructures and relations, through an institutional table that can only orientate my towards an ideology of efficient work.

What are the horizons of these inherited relations, and what is reachable from these positions? When the straight/atomic home is orientated so that there is a \"requirement that we bring home the \"other sex\" ... ''same race\"\" (Ibid, 127), then it is orientated to be self-perpetuating, autopoetic, and demanding a \"good likeness\". This orientation of a home demands that everyone be \"in line\" and maintain the norms and order of things, making sure that the relations and hierarchies \"line up\" between generations. Ahmed gives an example of drawing on tracing paper, copying lines over, and the sophisticated apparatus that philosophers, researchers, designers and institutional tables maintain to keep lines straight by \"holding\" things in place. These institutional apparatuses often smooth over any lumps, bumps, pains and aches that could queer the line and make it deviate.

Queer in a spatial context means a twist in space, and when we combine this with definitions of sexual orientation, it poses a bent, deviant or crooked sexuality. Ahmed starts to queer the straight line to make wiggle room to thinking about how to approach relations on this horizon. If we are to move straight towards an object, as a singular other from determinate positions, then we can only take a straight path towards it<a data-footref=\"x8\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.02_queering_the_axis.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. She demonstrates this at the dining table where one man sits opposite one woman. This emerges into the family table where we have set sides and positions. Ahmed shows how this line straightens out a queer or crooked one by pushing us to choose one side of the table. Ahmed questions how the queer line is portrayed as oblique when held against the straight line, even posing that the straight line needs the queer one against which to appear comparatively straight. Ahmed reorients this idea through her figure of the \"contingent lesbian\" (Ibid, 92), which queers Freud's notion of a \"contingent introvert\", who positions queerness as a lack of finding a partner of the other sex, and so turns to her own by default. Ahmed inverts this relation to position straightness as contingent, and sees lesbians not as defaulting to queerness in the lack of a suitable person of the other sex, but defaulting to straightness and the other sex when the familial line and sedimented straight norms put queer bodies out of reach. Here she is thinking about this not as a \"coming out\" as queer or lesbian but as \"coming to\" queerness through desire. This reorients these relations towards queer desire and away from the \"requirement\" of a straight line. This makes room for me to understand how I approach the world along my own crooked or deviant lines that take me towards different people, communities, relations and in doing so shape my body and sediment my own paths.<br>Key to this critique is a queer reading of Merleau-Ponty's \"sensitive body\"<a data-footref=\"x9\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.02_queering_the_axis.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> where Ahmed reflects on how inhabiting space produces a space to be inhabited. For example, a soft bottom creates a softer seat, that creates a softer bottom and softer seat. This concept is used to figure how a queer twist in the straight line of inheritance is itself conducive to forming a line that has room and capacity to be twisted. To think this through, she takes up the butch-femme dynamic of lesbian relations, and critiques not only the hetero perception of needing sexual difference or an opposite to attract but also queer critiques like Joan Nestle's \"phony heterosexual replicas\" that mimic this. With the help of Judith Butler she poses that the real need here is to question the necessity for difference in queer attraction, of the \"requirements\" of desire and relations. Ahmed instead positions these roles as performances as \"erotic possibilities that can generate new lines of desire only when they are just that: possibilities rather than requirements\" (Ibid, 99). In doing this she is opening up the possibility for bodies to not be determined by set relations but to be things to be desired, pursued, subverted and felt out. In this move she plays on lesbian fictions of Butch-Butch relations within Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues as well as Lee Lynch's The Swashbuckler, to show the comical navigation of desire of self within lesbian culture. She turns here though to state that these performed lines and bodily horizons of butch-femme are not illegitimate, but cautions against drawing \"a dividing line\" that can in itself \"make other forms of sexual desire unlivable\"(Ibid, 99). In this research, I have been playing with these ideas around queer relations in the context of wider intimacies, from how roles such as users and experts are performed with digital network infrastructures, to the emerging of indeterminate collaborative and collective desires.Ahmed takes Merleau-Ponty's notion of the \"sensitive body\" to discuss how this \"coming to\" queerness shapes and forms our bodies through being in relation with and touching other queer bodies. She explains how being oriented towards other women doesn't just shape our sexuality, but also what other objects are reachable on our horizon. She shares how queer and lesbian desires move us sideways, taking us to different associations and connections that are often invisible to others. As I follow my own queer path she encourages the refusal of this straightening up, to not look back or reorient ourselves to/around straight heckles, however offensive they are, and to instead orient towards my own queer promise. This queering of the axis is to stay disoriented, to orient into possibilities that straight lines could never map, and to touch and hold our bodies in our own economies. A queer axis is one where the horizontal and vertical lines of inheritance don't always \"line up\", can be \"off line\", and challenge the sedimentations that hold me in place, force me to one side and keep me out of reach of me needs and desires.<br>Removing the \"holding\" things in place, in this research when I move this metaphorical tracing paper to other tables and relations; the grooves in these different tables inducing a queering that animates these sedimented lines to be drawn otherwise. This means that if I take a seat at institutional tables as a crip and queer<a data-footref=\"x10\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.02_queering_the_axis.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, even if it isn't orientated, approachable or stable to me, I am mutually affecting it. It means that when I bring myself, my thoughts and research to other queer tables, of coalition and of crip care, I can be comfy in our shared disorientation at hegemonic tables. The research I am doing gets slanted with my body to my other queerer axes. When I come to institutional tables along these queer axes, I take them off balance, grasping at them and nudging them to an orientation I need. This is a very queer dance that begins to happen when I refuse to be held in place, or hold other things out of place. I start to be able to be flexible in how I orient myself, begin to be able to feel my needs and to form tables and relations of affinity that feel mutual, constitutive and affective. <br>\"The straight line would be that which moves without any deviation toward the\"point\" of heterosexual union or sexual coupling: any acts that postpone the heterosexual union are perverse, which thus includes heterosexual practices that are not \"aimed\" toward penetration of the vagina by the penis\"(Ahmed 2006, 78)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.01.02_queering_the_axis.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"At the same time that we acknowledge this risk of universalism, we could queer Merleau-Ponty's ''sensitive body,'' or even suggest that such a body is already queer in its sensitivity ''to all the rest.''

Much like Ahmed's navigation of butch-femme dynamics, transdisciplinarity is not meant to de-legitimise disciplinary fields or sedimented relations, but is meant to approach them as performances of knowledge and practices. Orienting disciplines in this way means that I can start to make room for what was once \"unlivable\" in disciplines' inherited terms. Again, this approach in its disobedience doesn't outright discredit the disciplines it works with but asks how their performed orientations may cross and transpose one another, what that could put in reach, and how making disciplines touch in other ways reshapes the bodily horizons of the disciplines themselves. This moves the focus from boundaries to orientations and how I can trace situated queer paths between disciplinary lines for myself. In this research, I bring together and move across fields of queer feminism, crip theory, critical access, disability justice, STS, media studies, information studies, artistic/creative practice, and software studies, to ask how a crip network and collective organisational practices can be made live-able between the institutions of computing and academia that systematically invalidate disabled queer lives. <br>\"Sometimes that is what we struggle for: wiggle room; to have spaces to breathe.

Ahmed is in many ways an amazing commentator on disability and anti-ableism, but here I turn to Alison Kafer's table, and to her work with her Feminist, Queer, Crip. Kafer's formation of the Political/Relational model of disability, and discussion on Crip Time as a concept makes room for me to question through more focused crip lens how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (Ahmed, 2006). In doing so I am thinking through how politics and relations form and hold disability in place, and in turn how through community, interdependence and collective access in action can make room for disability's indeterminacy to manifest many other futures together. I also inquire into Kafer's figuring of crip time not only as a way to hold many indeterminate bodies, but also as a way to understand and navigate the scoping of actions taken in this research. I reflect on the many scales that collaborative labours take, especially around manifesting collective infrastructures, from the infinite small meetings and feelings that I could never capture, to scales of maintenance that could have ended yesterday, or could stretch beyond my lifetime. With this, I also slip onto Kafer's table the Crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) by Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch, to re-orient these dialogues towards social and technical infrastructures and science technology studies (STS). Here I orient the crip as a social and technical hacker, reforming and manifesting infrastructures through direct action, affective feedback and refusal that centre crip knowledge and experience within making and doing. With this I ask what does it take for crips to make and sit cozily at tables of disability justice, access and life affirmation within and around institutions and infrastructures of research, computation and care? I want to approach these questions with others, within our capacity, with passion, pleasure and joy, asking: where/how can we make room to imagine and practise other political relations of liberation and affirmation, now?!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The Crip Table","level":2,"id":"The_Crip_Table_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.00_the_crip_table.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612762,"modifiedTime":1756048612762,"sourceSize":2217,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.00_The_Crip_Table.md","exportPath":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.00_the_crip_table.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.01_politicalrelational_model.html":{"title":"02.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model","icon":"","description":"Alison Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip is a foundational work for understanding how disability can be analysed from a crip perspective and approach. It looks to complicate the way that disability is represented and mediated, moving on from both the medical model and social model of disability, to one that can hold the diversity of intersections queer and disabled bodies experience as well as making room to critique the wider implications of a cure narrative. In the medical model of disability, as Kafer notes, quoting Simi Linton, \"the proper approach to disability is to \"'treat' the condition and the person with the condition rather than 'treating' the social processes and policies that constrict disabled people's lives.\"\" (2013, 5). The medical model treats the sickness or \"abnormality\" of disabled people on an individual basis and in doing so ignores and invalidates the background to their potentially disabling social relation. In doing this the medical model also ignores the experiences of disabled people whose bodies are not only most affected by these orientations, but also have the affective and situated knowledges that are essential to their nuanced affirming care. The medical model sees that \"solving the problem of disability, then, means correcting, normalising, or eliminating the pathological individual\" (Ibid, 5). A cure here can mean returning to being \"able bodied\" but it can also be interpreted as society being cured of disabled bodies. This medical model draws a line that forces disabled people to one side, and off of the table systematically through isolating them from it financially (Ibid, 39), as well as through eugenic regimes of genetic selection (Ibid, 76) and curing ideologies of technological enhancement (Ibid, 107).A later and more accepted model within the disabled community is the social model, which aims to draw attention to the social aspects and the background of disability that the medical model invalidates. It does this through an 'impairment/disability' axis, which makes room to understand what a person is capable of and how a society/system can limit their abilities relationally. To do this the social model defines impairment as \"any physical or mental limitation\" (Ibid, 7) and argues that \"disability signals the social exclusions based on, and social meanings attributed to, that impairment\" (Ibid, 7). Kafer sums it up simply: \"impairments aren't disabling, social and architectural barriers are\" (Ibid, 7). This is in many ways generative for re-approaching disability's \"problems\", moving them from the individual to societal, infrastructural and political scales.With Susan Wendell, Kafer queries the social model by asking, \"how far one must be able to walk to be considered able-bodied\" (Ibid, 7). While seemingly simple, this question opens many political and relational queries. What are the geographies (are there smooth walkways on flat-ish land?), economics (could they afford the walking aid or pain relief tablets?) community relations (was their friend free and able to help, or community carer available?), politics (are their medications legal?) and infrastructures (were they able to connect to a community, was an input valid on a form?). These questions move the approach away from a standardised test on an individual, and into understanding the nuances of disabling political dynamics on people's abilities, relationally and societally. Wendell and Kafer consider both impairment and disability to be socially constructed, as bodies are only seen as disabled in relation to sedimented \"able\" ones. Returning to Ahmed, we could ask how Crips line up to the determinate straight able-bodied line or axis? And Crips would probably respond, \"huh? what axis?\", or, maybe on another day, feeling more provocative, \"We don't have to!\"Kafer also notes that the social model, when taken to an extreme, inverts the orientation of the medical model, and in doing so can invalidate people with disabilities. An example is of those disabled people who acknowledging their pain or other impairments may have a desire for a cure to them, but this in the social model could be read as playing into the medical models' narrative of a cure they are trying to counter. In this inversion it can also overlook the fact that some disabilities, such as chronic health, pain and fatigue, will not change no matter how much we change social relations. Along this thread the social model also negates to contemplate how a cure narrative towards a particular (abled) kind of body can affect people who might not identify as disabled or be \"impaired\". Kafer gives the examples of anti-ageing creams that can play on the anxieties of getting old as well as growth hormones for shorter children to make them \"normal\" height. Both can be understoon as ableist and reliant on a curative model. From this orientation, we can understand how the social model orients disability to be delineated along fine lines, and in many ways undermines the radical knowledges of disabled experiences and the relations they can put in reach.Kafer proposes the political/relational model to reorient the social model's impairment/disability axis. Kafer's model asks what immediate changes to relations not only validate, but also ease and make room to build up the capacities of people living with experiences of disability, neurodiversity, chronic illness and pain \"under any circumstances\" (Ibid, 41), which I go on to discuss further in the next section on Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures.In action, navigating disability through these models can be quite sad, as we understand how overwhelming these social and institutional politics and pressures are on our crip bodyminds, and how violent, forceful and invalidating they are in action. However, by making room to navigate and analyse these institutional tables and their bodily horizons from a crip orientation, we are able to set out our own paths to move around the sinkholes and vacuums they hold in place to erase our lives, experiences and voices from the discourse about disabled people and our place in the future. In this research this takes the form of questioning how I have collectively organise around and with technology, away from curative narratives of efficiency and control within these institutional politics, and instead towards collective care, maintenance and access towards our own crip social and technical infrastructures.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Political/Relational Model","level":3,"id":"Political/Relational_Model_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.01_politicalrelational_model.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612762,"modifiedTime":1756048612763,"sourceSize":6485,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md","exportPath":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.01_politicalrelational_model.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html":{"title":"02.02.02_Crip_Time_+_Crip_Futures","icon":"","description":"\n\"Can we tell crip tales, crip time tales, with multiple befores and afters, proliferating befores and afters, all making more crip presents possible?\" (Kafer 2021, 418)\nOne of the focuses of Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip and her wider research is her figuring out of crip time. Crip time is manifested by many different people in crip theory, from Ellen Samuel's Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time (2017), to Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011, p.&nbsp;62) which offers generative affective definitions, to Kafer's After Crip, Crip Afters (2021) and David P. Terry's Explanation not Excuse (2016) that poetically describe crip times. Prioritizing Crip Futures (Abrams et al., 2024) and Sins Invalid's Crip Kinship of Sins Invalid (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;75) also offer crip time in action in institutional and crip collective contexts. Crip time here makes room for a paradoxical and non-linear temporality that aims to sit with disabled people's bodies and experiences on their terms instead of enforcing a normative able-bodied orientation of time<a data-footref=\"x12\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. In essence, crip time is the refusal of determinate, straight, evenly-paced timelines. I choose to build from Kafer's definitions because of her emphasis on the systemic and political relations of temporalities that freeze and hold crips and disabled folks in place, as well as the ways we can hack and form wiggle room within these dominant hegemonic times. Kafer builds up her definition through a few moves but starts by cripping Lee Edelman's queer time against the future (Kafer 2013, 28). Here she takes up the figure of the 'Child' as a symbol of the future that in queer theory is often also a symbol of the deterministic straight line of inheritance towards able straight futures<a data-footref=\"x13\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. The figure of the Child is also heavily bound to the histories of eugenics, which conflated disabled, racialised, poor and indigenous bodies into the categories \"feeble-minded\" or \"defective\", and used to justify forced sterilisation or euthanasia for the future of the \"race\" (Ibid, 30). The legacies of these eugenic logics persist in contemporary prenatal selection and abortion of disabled children to \"solve\" the problem before it starts, and which the UK has re-enitiated this year (Maia Davies 2025). This emphasis on the future reinforces the endless deferral of care for disabled folks, that instead of making room and capacity to care for them now, orients funding to cure society and futures of their disabled bodies. One example Kafer takes up is of Noam Ostrander's interviews with young black men in Chicago with violently acquired spinal cord injuries (Ibid, 33). She highlights this case as it not only shows how the violent relations through which these men became disabled are so sedimented that their disabling was treated as inevitable, but also that becoming disabled was a foreclosure on their life, and one that determined them to have no future. Here she is sharing how disability is imagined by ableism to have no future, and that to authoritarian eugenics logics, reinforced through race, class, sexuality, gender identity and more, determine disability as a category to forcibly place bodies that they do not want to see in the future.In her book Kafer engages with the figure of the \"Child\" to disorient dialogues around disabled bodies that do not seem to fit in hegemonic futures. She does this by inquiring into both disabled peoples abilities to procreate more disabled bodies (children), as well as exploring the capacities disabled people have to procreate culture, social relations and intimacies. By doing so, she questions the hegemonic terms through which disability's futures are represented. She elaborates on this by studying both mainstream media narratives playing out these political imaginaries and contemporary social and technical infrastructures that reinforce these ableist politics systemically.For example, Kafer reads Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time, and its legacy within feminist studies as a text that demonstrates \"inclusivity\" and political democracy within science (Ibid, 72). Through a crip lens, Kafer's analysis shows it is anything but inclusive or democratic. This Utopian world has in fact eradicated all disabled people without any mention or dialogue that included them. The fictive society is in many ways Utopian because it has eradicated disabled people through genetic science and technological advancement. The fictive infrastructure that has enabled this is called the brooder, which mixes and selects genes to form neutral healthy children of all races, but in doing so eradicates disabled bodies without question. In the same move it also blends and displaces race as a way to cure us of cultural difference and racial inequality. When held in comparison to the depicted Dystopia, which is filled with disabled and mad bodyminds, it shares how disabled people's existence here represents one of the main signifies of this utopian/dystopian split. Beyond the macro of this split, the only mention of disability in the utopia is of people taking mental health breaks, where they drop out from society. This in many ways still enacts the erasure of disability from society, put to one side, siloed and hidden from sight until normal or cured. Through Kafer's analysis she shows how neither the utopian nor dystopian futures make room for or imagine disabled people to live full lives, or affirm their experiences. In these futures disabled people are either the abundant problem or are silently cured from existence as part of the solution. In these narratives, disabled bodies, feelings and experiences are not included in the making of futures. In utopia, they have been invalidated and backgrounded at every step towards this \"greater good\".<br>In response I have shared how Kafer constructs a crip time that makes room to hold the affective, embodied and experiential relations to time that disabled bodies have the capacity to feel. This affective crip relation to time emerges through disabling relations to institutions, systems and infrastructures, or just how disabled bodyminds queerly move through and experience time and space<a data-footref=\"x14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. Kafer presents many forms of crip time, from the slowing down and indefinite postponing of care, to the immediacy of when we need to care right now. Crip time takes the form of cycles of time that complicate the normative straight cycles of the able-bodied clock, and disables people from accessing in-flexible institutions, financial stability and self-determinacy.Kafer aligns crip time with Jack Halberstam's discussion of queer time, in particular the \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\" of queer life (Ibid, 35). For Halberstam,the immediacy of the AIDS crisis, specifically for gay men and their communities took them out of mainstream and normative time, to a time of \"the here, the present, the now\" (Ibid, 35). In crip contexts, Kafer describes a \"falling time\". Falling ill or getting a prognosis changes perceptions of time, shrinks futures and intensifies the present. When falling into depression, time is slowed to a stop, yet can fly by. How does time feel when there are uncertainties as to whether a chemical, food or unpredictable trigger could induce symptoms that will take you out of time? These fallings into \"strange temporalities\" leaves space for disabled people to feel these times as they are and not line-up to a straight and normative time, validating and enabling crip bodies to tell stories that can change how we think with time.For \"imaginative life schedules\" Kafer brings to the forefront the ways that disabled people have to pre-plan and hack systems of care to be in reach of their needs. How partners and friends need to split carers and medicines, as systems have valued one over the other. How families and friends need to fill the gaps. How bathroom visits have to be pre-planned and scheduled. Kafer poses these \"imaginative life schedules\" not just as the extenuated day to day planning that most disabled people take on, but as the need to project crip bodies into the future to maintain them. This maintenance is highlighted not just as (re)production that we see within efficiency models, but as pleasurable acts of each day, and towards unknown practices of radical access. These schedules then become a place with a possibility of joy for organising and maintaining embodied futures for disabled lives that resist the violence of institutional and hegemonic determination of disabled futures.With \"eccentric economic practices\" Kafer talks about the ways that crip people are economic hackers. When the lines of systemic and institutional care don't hold you and you start to slip through. When they limit how much you can earn to maintain your care subsidies and determine you into a certain level of (dis)comfort. This is when these eccentric economics are necessitated and practised, to trade goods, favours and pleasures under the radar so that crips don't compromise our basic needs and care. These economics for Kafer this offers a blurring of the public/private in a way that makes room for these economics to be a test bed for us to imagine what crip politics in action might be capable of. This is where our everyday practices of collective access and interdependence become radical methods for rethinking the politics of how we come together and table, or put to bed our differences.<br>Kafer's situates crip time between a time of falling in the here and now, meanwhile maintaining our bodies to enact a future with us in it by practising politics of our everyday. Kafer goes on to examine how this framing of crip time lines up against narratives of longevity, focusing on cripping Halberstam's notion of keeping going \"under any circumstances\"<a data-footref=\"x15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html#fn-4-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>. In a queer refusal of longevity, hegemony is understood to reproduce deterministic futures indefinitely. A crip position instead sits with each situated body differently. Kafer asks what it means for that or this body to keep going \"under any circumstance\"<a data-footref=\"x16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.02_crip_time_+_crip_futures.html#fn-5-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a>, and how can we ease the institutional and social pressures that curtail crip life at every turn. Here she is moving to also step out of line and inquire, \"what are the circumstances we need but also desire?\", and by asking this, also asking how to orient them to be within reach.To make time for crip time, where we feel our crip bodies maintained in a future that holds them is to radically reconfigure our relations to almost every part of our lives under efficient time. To embody a future with us in it is to practice access as affirmation and to make room and time for people to consent, to be present in and the capacity to care for that time. A future embodied by crips would aim to foster time from a another radical set of roots that can overlay, intertwine and embrace a plurality of times. This radical embrace of crip time makes room within relations, futures and immediate actions that make time for us to hold this crip stuff with care \"under any circumstances\".<br>To tie down and bring in-line the proliferating befores and afters of these indeterminate crip time tales, as I have had to for this thesis, I have thought about how to find orientation within space and time that shifts, trickles and lets loose without reason. To sit in disorientation is to be crip, and to be crip is to be more than aslant from the straight axis of time.

This is due to the variety of bodies, experiences and struggles that exist under the broad terms of disability. Of course we can turn to Kimberly Crenshaw's definition of intersectionality(Crenshaw 1991; 2015), and it's emergence from groups like the Combahee River Collective, where \"interlocking oppressions\" form at the cross roads of identities. This in many ways comes from and speaks to disability (even if it is not overtly stated), but I find it more interesting to look at definitions that come from the overt practices of crip studies. This Crip kinship (2021) as Shayda Kafai would term it, is where the abundance of crip communities and interdependence of intersections shine. Kafai's book centres on the practices of Sins Invalid, a crip performance group started by Patty Berne and Leroy Moore. Sins Invalid's work centres expressing crip pleasures, joy and desire without shame and through interdependence. The group's definition of intersectionality is one that I hold dear in my research and repeatedly reflect on in my practice.\n\"Sins Invalid defines intersectionality this way: \"Simply put, this principle says that we are many things, and they all impact us. We are not only disabled, we are also each coming from a specific experience of race, class, sexuality, age, religious background, geographic location, immigration status, and more. Depending on context, we all have areas where we experience privilege, as well as areas of oppression... We gratefully embrace the nuance that this principle brings to our lived experiences, and the ways it shapes the perspectives we offer.\"\" (Ibid, 31)\nThis definition of intersectionality by Sins Invalid has helped me to think through how I can come together with collaborators to practice crip freedoms together. To treat these intersections with care and situate our capacities, privileges and desires into and out of alignment. Kafer also notes Robert McRuer's notion of \"the non-disabled claim to be crip\" (2013, p.&nbsp;169), which I follow: the possibility of able bodied crips, of those working for the disabled cause, but also maybe those that recognise the \"the disability to come.\" Committing to this wider scope of intersectional disability justice is a key step for any crip studies critique, as accessibly explained in Ella Parry-Davies' Coming out Crip (2022) audio piece. She, much like myself, is only \"stable\" because we live in the UK with a state health system that recognises our needs, and can \"treat\" them in its medical scoping of our conditions. If we were to live elsewhere, have different nationalities and the relational support those bodies have, we might not even be here, or able to make these statements. With this we embed ourselves within the mutual cause against all intersecting injustices towards disability.In this dialogue privilege and oppression are situated and negotiated both with intimacy. With this I have asked how can I as a white crip researcher, within academic institutions that are often inaccessible to other intersections of disabled people, use my privilege and oppression in this experience and context to leverage resources and change discourses to position disability justice and radical access as the next action I take at every turn? It also asks me to know that I will never know the experiences of other people with disability and to have patience and commitment, to get in touch with and to learn to communicate our collective sense making. It is to take our sweet crip ass time to get a feel for one another, and affirm each other along that path and journey.I find it important to think through intersectionality with Kafer's reading of Ashley-X's story. This is because it offers clearly the ways we have to defy the urge to divide disability through its diversity, but to instead centre and care for these bodies on the margins of our discourse. Ashley is born with \"static encephalopathy\", that leads her doctors to state that \"her development never progressed beyond that of an infant\", and means that she depends on constant care for her lifetime. The nickname by carers for the condition and similar disabilities is a \"pillow angel\". Another element of this relation is that her body developed at a \"normal\" pace, and at age 6 her parents started to be concerned about what puberty would do to her. From consultations with medical \"experts\" they set up a plan to remove Ashley's uterus and breast buds, as well as put here on a high dose oestrogen regime. The medical \"experts\" in dialogue with the parents validated this treatment for many reasons, from \"saving\" Ashley from pains of menopause and puberty, as well as keeping her small so her parents could care and protect her directly, as well as keeping her safe from her own mature body. This meant that the way Ashley and her body were unconsensually treated was to be shaped for the able bodied world around them. They just made her easy to handle as well as protected from relations held in place by ableist and violent sexist politics. I work with Kafer's reading of Ashley for a few reasons, partially as it highlights the ways disabled bodies and experiences are curtailed to fit the hard ableist systems, scales and needs, instead of considering the disabled bodymind's own needs, orientations and desires. It also shares the length that these sorts of ableist actions can be taken to, how far an individual who cannot oppose can be shaped to fit the efficient line, instead of questioning the political relations of the line itself. This is highlighted by some mixed views from both medicine and disability studies, whether a person like Ashley-X is too disabled to be disabled, and whether people like them need their own category (Kafer 2013, 67). This division provokes yet another boundary beyond the able/disabled projected axis, forming again new complex parameters that permit questionably dehumanising and violent treatments, such as the one Ashley-X recieved. Kafer asks here what if we place people like Ashley-X not outside of disability discourse, but in the centre of it? When I start to imagine relations and tables to care for these experiences and not determine and invalidate their communication ability, I open myself up to feel and be felt through many yet unknowable ways. Kafer's enactment of crip theory here also centres the joy of this communication. In Ashley-X's case, a double mastectomy and hormone blockers to stop her breasts growing means that Ashley was also disabled from having any pleasure from these removed organs. Their pleasure was never imagined, nor valued in their future, only pain. That just because these experts were did not have the capacity to feel Ashley's expressions of joy, imagine their bodily possibilities of pleasure and agency, or even contemplate their political desires meant that it was these experts who had invalidated Ashley without question or dialogue. Instead of joy or pleasure, the dialogues around Ashley's body focus on pain or discomfort and keeping her secure from strangers, who may also feel this discomfort around her. Reflecting on Ashley-X through crip intersectionality, it can also be understood that this probably only happened to her as she came from a middle class American family that could afford to treat her through these medical industrial institutions. When I highlight her context, I think to how I can build up capacities to be in dialogue with each other. This is also amplified by disability as such a diverse field that includes so many bodyminds in so many different situated social/political relations. Again a crip move is to centre joy and pleasure as an actionable site for us to move from, but this is not to say we silence or ignore the very real pain that exists everyday within our community internationally and intersectionally. It instead aims to move beyond deterministic narratives of disability as painful and awkward and asking what brings us together through joy, comfort and pleasure, even if we are dealing with pain, depression and disabling social relations. Through feeling out these restraints we can start to move towards interdependently asking/demanding how to put our desires in reach of one another?In Kafer's final chapter, 'Accessible Futures, Future Coalitions', she gives an example of Silvia Yee's work with the Disability rights education and Defense Fund (DreDF) (2013, p.&nbsp;160). Kafer highlights their work with communities facing the overburden of toxic industries and emissions to show how policy and access put in place to help disabled people in many ways benefits everyone. In the case of DreDF the rights of children with respiratory issues can stop schools and institutions from using potentially harmful chemical pesticides, which can benefit not only the quality of life of everyone in that district but also reduces the ecological impacts. This presents Crip intersectionality as a powerful place where in coalition we can leverage our communities access privileges to not only improve their individual lives but to put a future we all want into reach.This is where the interdependence of crips also sits as an essential practice. When disabled people struggle to perform as required by a system or to be valued the same as able-bodied people, communities have to help each other manage the gaps. Like I shared in Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures with Kafer's take on Halberstam's \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\", all of these crip times are threaded through community schedules, care and interdependence. These acts can range from just consolidating to each other that it is fine that we are sad and mad, that there are gaps in what we are able to do, and being there when we almost fall through them.In the third episode of the Crip Club podcast<a data-footref=\"x18\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> , which discusses disabled representation in films and media, Clare Baines interviews Jessi Gutch around cancer portrayals (Baines, o.&nbsp;J.). In the podcast they not only talk around what it means for Gutch to not fit into the curative narrative of cancer, but she also shares her experiences of living with a disability whilst working in the film industry. The section I felt was most informative for understandings of intersectionality and interdependence of disabled folk, is when she is talking about working in a majority disabled set. This crip background informed a very different set of expectations and capacities for one another. Gutch says that this formed a space where people could express their needs easily and have them affirmed, where everyone on set knew that this film was important, but not the most important thing. The most important thing is that everyone in this collaboration was feeling as good as they could in their bodyminds and able to do what they wanted to within the collaboration. It was where if they needed more time for this crip stuff they could have it without question.<br>In my practice as I have started to collaborate with more disabled and crip people I have also felt this same energy, where our wellbeing, capacities and feelings are prioritised over an imagined deterministic outcome or performance of work. I talk more about this in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a> section, but to touch on one of these collaborations that is of note here was in the creation of the crip infrastructure en-crip-ing time<a data-footref=\"x19\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, a work that imagines and instigates crip times within computational time. I go on to discuss this work in context and in more detail in a later inquiry discussed in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time</a>. Here though one major part of the work was to focus on this type of crip relating between my collaborator Mariana Marangoni and I in the making of the infrastructure. This meant that there were no agile time-lines, roles or outcomes here, just crip times, flexibility and compassion. We both had many demands from life, and very crip times in relation to our bodyminds, but we both understood that for this intersection and crip infrastructure to emerge we both needed these times to prioritise our needs. When one of us had to freeze time to recover or get through something it was okay, we just said, and adjusted the timeline or responsibilities. When one got stressed and anxious about the imposed time-lines, the other didn't combat this, but comforted it. The expectations would be flexible to fit our current capacities, and frictions became places to orient from and to learn each other's needs and approaches. These social politics, ways of relating and maintaining crip infrastructure became important to show in the work. To make it present in the background of the work we added comment sections in the html of the poem, showing our conversations of making time and space for this crip stuff.<br>Here I return again and again to imagine where we can find joy in rubbing up against each other's supports and restraints in relation, and how this practice is a language we all have to practise and build capacity for independently. It is a language of sensing what each other's capacities, privileges, knowledges, desires and feelings are, and learning to understand them as they unfold. In a crip intersectionality I turn to this movement of coalition and interdependence in action, of bringing together divergent bodies and movements to manifest the change we as a group need now. Crip coalitions in themselves are temporary comings together of differing politics, structures, goals and needs to configure the social and technical infrastructure for change and affirmation we need now. In Ren Britton's Coalition Bouquet<a data-footref=\"x20\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, they trace many of these histories and the improvised technologies, politics and communities that came together to blossom crip change together. Here these often complex, divergent and temporary coalitions can move beyond the predetermining confines of pain, which they may be in, to where they can reorient the issues of intersectional access to make room to hold the possibility of joyous direct action and change.In this research, this has been taken up as working between different departments, institutions, collective, projects, coalitions, mailing lists, servers and etherpads. Most importantly though, for me as a person with fatigue, chronic pain and other complicating factors, this has meant pushing for accessible ways of managing and maintaining collective practices, and trying to introduce a disorienting crip axis to (dis)align with. This inquiry has been about intersectionally and interdependently reorienting practices, figures, timelines, expectations, infrastructures and priorities. In particular, inquiring into how I can question my own role in these dynamics to support crip politics, both in our organisation and by making them accessible to collaborators. I am also taking this up in response to broader questions of interdependence within the networks, infrastructures, and politics these collaborations manifest and are held in place by. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://thecripclub.co.uk/podcast/\" target=\"_self\">https://thecripclub.co.uk/podcast/</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://time.cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://time.cozy-cloud.net/</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://lorenbritton.com/projects/coalition-bouquet\" target=\"_self\">https://lorenbritton.com/projects/coalition-bouquet</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Crip intersectionality &amp; Coalition","level":3,"id":"Crip_intersectionality_&_Coalition_0"}],"links":["02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0",".html","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0",".html","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0","02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#fnref-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612763,"modifiedTime":1756048612764,"sourceSize":15470,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/02_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md","exportPath":"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html":{"title":"02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience","icon":"","description":"For \"cripping\" technology, Cielo Saucedo and Nat Decker's Cripping_Computer_Graphics (2023) which I touch upon later when <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> for the Cozy-Cloud server. I highlight this essay here though as they are working with Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of \"cripping\" (2003, 37), as a way to feel out in action the ableist assumptions and inaccessible norms of computer graphics and the relations/politics of technoscience more broadly by bringing embodied knowledges and practices of crips in touch with them.Bringing it back to Kafer's work In Feminist, Queer, Crip, she is cripping technoscience by inquiring into the figure of the cyborg and orienting it around disability on two points of contact/impact. Initially, she questions how media represents disabled dependence on technology as real-life cyborgs, leading to the \"rise of the cyborg\" as the unquestionable and naturalised cure for disabled folks. From here she then moves towards a crip critique of Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, away from the naturalised cyborg~crip relations and towards practising relations that challenge the militarised imaginaries of cyborgs and disabled bodies through a disorienting and disobedient crip approach. This refusal, not of these technologies, but of how their imaginaries are oriented, politicised and enacted, is key to my disobedient crip research into technology.Kafer's media analysis of cyborgs shows that they are again sedimented without question to be a cure for impairment, to make 'normal' disabled bodies. These narratives, as raised by Kafer's analyses of Chris Hables Gray's Cyborg Citizen, lead to Gray, an able-bodied science studies scholar, taking up the late Superman actor Christopher Reeve, without his knowledge or consent, as a heroic cyborg leading the way for the disabled community. Gray suggests that the \"crippling of superman\" and Reeve becoming dependent on multiple machines and devices is one of the best examples of a \"true\" cyborg. Gray states that Reeve is a hero as he leads the way for other disabled bodies to be cured through assistive technologies. Gray's text in a number of ways undermines the disabled experience, as it doesn't make room for Reeve or people with disabilities, and more specifically quadriplegic people, to speak to their use of and relation to access and assisted living technologies. Kafer also points out that Gray overlooks and cannot imagine that there is a wider disabled community than just the celebrity in focus, Reeve, or that these communities have a long history and culture of living with assistive technologies that might be informative. Kafer also shares how his use of language often refers to people with disabilities as \"invalids\" or \"patients\", conflating their whole identity and personhood with an injury or the medical identification of their condition. Sitting here, Kafer figures Gray as a prime example of how the disabled bodies are oriented when deployed in cyborg theory. In one of many other examples, Annie Potts' \"taxonomy of cyborgs\" places Reeves in a list with fictional cyborgs, orienting him as less human and more cyborg, a construction rather than a complex, multifaceted person. In these cyborg curing narratives, Kafer shows how this signalling of disabled people as the truest cyborgs locks in and has sedimented the path so much that a cyborg itself becomes a signal for disability, abnormality and difference. The cyborg~crip, the crip~cyborg.By contrast, Kafer reads Haraway's figure of a \"cyborg\" in the Cyborg Manifesto (2006) as problematic in some aspects, but an empowering plurality to think through when approaching with feminist STS. The problematic notions of the Harraway's cyborg are somewhat well known; for example, its homogenising of experiences ny taking an imperializing approach that dictates one figure of an identity for whole groups of people (Kafer 2013, 114). Kafer, however, offers a closer crip critique of Haraway's cyborg, tracing how she has also fallen into the sedimented route that portrays disabled bodies, or as she determines them \"paraplegics and other severely handicapped people\", to be exemplary or true cyborgs. In this move, Haraway makes a number of questionable choices. She addresses these imagined people with disabilities in terms of \"handicap\" and describes them as \"paraplegic\", which reinforces the individualism and diagnosis of the medical model. Kafer also points out this critique of naming languages was fairly common discourse within that era of disability studies, of which Haraway was likely aware. Haraway also homogenizes experiences of disabled people like she does for other identities, but in doing so displaces the affective relations to technologies these different disabled positions and experiences make room for. She essentially does not include any affective perspectives on what it feels like to be a person who is disabled and (inter)dependent with/on technologies and infrastructures.<br>Even though Haraway's \"cyborg\" is in many ways flawed, especially in relation to intersectional disability, Kafer still finds it to be generative from a crip position. In particular, the cyborg can also figure the defiant feminist care in and against flawed and often violent technoscience. The cyborg finds joy in acts of practising radical care otherwise. Kafer disorient the cyborg as a fluid figure that can make room for us to figure out other paths between people with disabilities and the technologies that support them. She refigures the cyborg as a place of embodied crip futures, on their/our terms, validating and tracing a plurality of paths we take with technology together. It is this focus on how the cyborg makes room for crip studies to cross paths with other disciplines and experiences that is what makes this a generative space for her. Kafer gives examples of different cyborg intersections within disability studies, such as Dean Spade's research into the medicalisation of transgender identities. Spade navigates trans experiences of gender identity disorder (GID), which is used to validate care and medication, but also acts to reinforce the binary of gender as well as prolong and delay care (Kafer 2013, 124). GID also leads to tensions, with potentially ableist undertones and a medicalisation of queer identities, where needing to self-identify and be validated as having a \"condition\" or disorder to be treated as trans could lead to gender identity being read as an individual handicap instead of political and relational issue. Spade also reads this medicalisation of GID as reproducing the \"curing\" narrative, where specific treatments can resolve the individual \"problem\" of gender identity, and can be industrialised. Kafer works with Spade and others here to trouble these notions by stating \"that neither medical technologies nor diagnoses can be characterized as purely oppressive or politically neutral\" (Ibid, 125). This disorientation feels the individual within the relational, situated, and makes room for the cyborg and their bodily horizons to be read as \"maps of power and identity\". In doing this, the cyborg also makes space for \"affinity-through-difference\"<a data-footref=\"r21\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html#fn-1-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where disabled people as a very diverse community can come together and lay with the disorientation of these many contradictory bodily maps and horizons. With this Kafer figures crips to be cyborgs not because of their bodily relations and dependence on assistive technology and technical infrastructure, that have been naturalised to signal disability, but because of the political practices we disobediently undertake. These acts of refusal are the tracings of our own queer and crip lines, the feeling and coalescing of other crip techno bodies, tables and relations. Some examples of this kind of rubbing up against and disobeying technology, whilst living through it, is shared in Laura Forlano's many works critiquing the cyborg as a concept. In both her Hacking the Feminist Disabled Body (2016) and Living Intimately with Machines (2023) she foregrounds the disabled experience of technology and relation to it as a place of generative friction. If oriented this way it can make room for other perspectives, methods and ethics to be present and felt at these tables. Kafer concludes her analysis by vulnerably opening up the idea that the cyborg within this plurality is also not the only figure for disability, as some disabled experiences may relate more and some less to these technological entanglements. However, she does encourage attending to these sites where disability is pressent within discourse but not felt or made room for. Much like Kafer's intervention into Haraway's cyborg, I also take this approach later in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> with Lucy Suchmans Configuration (2012) to critique the ways disabled bodies can disorient the horizons and practices I take toward collective organisation and network infrastructures. <br>Kafer follows up on Feminist, Queer and Crip (2013) with a talk called Health Rebels: A Crip Manifesto for Social Justice (2017) as well as Manifesting Manifestos (2023). In the Health Rebels talk she covers many of the bases of her work that I have covered elsewhere, but through other informative anecdotes, experiences and relations through which to imagine this work. The focus in this talk is coalition, of cross-issue collaboration and working within difference together. In the talk Kafer appears to refigure her crip cyborg into a number of other figures, such as \"health rebels\", \"the checklist\", and \"the manifesto\". Health rebels play out somewhat similarly to the cyborg, as the defiant crips in the face of the medical industrial complex and institutional ableism. In coalition, living crip as method, multiple and indeterminate, forming frictions at our many horizons and intersection with these generalised and prescribed norms. Disobediently disoriented, aligning to the crip axes. The checklist represents the rubric, matrix or limited drop-down selection that indeterminate disabled bodies are (in)validated through. I discuss my experiences of this further in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> section, where efficient logics determine static lines that are used to invalidate needs, experiences, practises and knowledges. Building on her earlier troubling of the crip cyborg as the only figure to live by, Kafer loosens and refigures the manifesto to be a place of wiggle room, of playing out our dreams, testing out futures, of finding gaps and frictions in these manifestings as generative places to write other crip manifestos and imagine other futures from action. To do this she turns to queer theory, as we could easily to Ahmed, to reflect on how a manifesto (or an orientation) moves along a horizon, foreclosing and limiting some relations whilst putting some others in reach. For Kafer, quoting Audre Lorde, the manifesto is \"believing, working for what has not yet been while living fully in the present now.\"<a data-footref=\"r22\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html#fn-2-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> Here it acts as a place to live with uncertainty and practise actioning and inquiring into crip methods for indeterminate futures. Kafer later follows this talk up with her essay Manifesting Manifestos (2023) where she takes an even closer reading of this writing format. In this essay she traces their problematic past within patriarchal modernist thought that unifies bodies, but also the sedimented critique of feminist manifestos that call the mad and crazed. In this Kafer disobediently steps into this critque to question how the manifesto makes room for this crips to be mad with and through their madness. With Breanne Fahs, Kafer also proposes this crazed manifesto as a format that \"invites disorientation\" (2020, 5) as it makes room for a distortion of time and a projection of bodies into other futures not yet in reach, but desired now. She also offers with Kafer (2016) how manifestos are a place to iterate from, adapt, change and find holes in our plans and manifestings. Here again not invalidating, hidding or trying to cure these flaws but, as she reflects on with her students manifesto, it is about making change through embracing and being oriented through these many situated flaws on the plurality of bodily horizons I come into contact with. In this research I ask alongside Kafer how, through a plurality of manifestos, can crip studies and disability justice can take on struggles we may have never imagined before? And how can we try to make room for people and relations that have not yet been imagined or thought of at these sedimented institutional tables yet?In this research, I iterate on from (but still with) Kafer's plurality of crazed manifestos to work more closely with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019). This is to orient my research more closely towards critiques of technoscience, but also to highlight crip manifesting and manifestos in practice. Their manifesto reiterates Kafer's work in a similar way to what I have discussed here, but situates it through more specifically STS relevant examples and positions. Key examples that are relevant to this work include ADAPT activist forming and shaping physical infrastructures by pouring ramps and smashing curbs, as well as Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project forming social and media representation by and for disabled people. Both examples, and many other crip sociotechnical hackings they touch on, manifest forms of direct action, of making change and caring for community infrastructures where institutions invalidate the political/relational forms through which they perpetuate ableism. Hamraie and Fritsch orient the Crip Technoscience Manifesto itself through commitments, manifesting a crip technoscience specifically through direct actions, embodied protocols and political demands. They do this to not only make this manifesto clear and accessible, but also to project into the future the embodied actions and relations that could make room for crip discourses and politics in practices to flourish in relation to technoscience.I discuss these commitments below to highlight key orientations this work is building from.\n\"Crip technoscience centres the work of disabled people as knowers and makers.\"\nThis positions the everyday practices and experiences of disabled people as that which orients them to best know their bodyminds and relations to technologies and society. They work with a few examples of crip designers to show how this plays out in action. Alice Loomer, for instance, shows us how wheelchair maintenance and hacking by the person using it, even though not a frictionless experience, forms practices and knowledges of technology that are situated in relation to that body and its horizon. They quote Loomer saying, \"I have equipment that fits me\", offering how disabled knowing/making through embodied expertise of technologies can make room for these bodies within technoscience. This is not to glorify the Do-It-Yourself practices of disabled people, as some may not be able (or want) to do \"it\", but it is to uplift the \"world-dismantling and world-building labors\" that \"misfitting\" in the world as a crip means and to orient from that disorientation.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to access as friction.\"\n<br>Friction for Hamraie and Fritsch represents the refusal to fit in of crip technoscience, of wanting more than the slots you are offered in the determined checklist, and taking actions and making frictions to make that room. They lay with the \"non-compliant user\", from Ray Lifchez and Barbara Winslow's book Design for Independent Living (1979), who use technology as a friction against an inaccessible environment to highlight the change needed<a data-footref=\"r23\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html#fn-3-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. They also discuss Collin Kennedy, an activist and cancer patient, who refused capitalist time around care by spraying expanding foam into hospital car park meters. In doing so, Kennedy disabled the capacity of these infrastructures to monitor and charge patients visiting the hospital, and so forming new possibilities and imaginaries of crip time through direct action forming friction on the sedimented norms. When thinking of frictions, I also want to return to the section on <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> with Ashley-X, and think again about the possibility of curtailed joys and pleasures that can come from the frictions of our disabled lives. With crip technoscience this also aims to ask how direct actions, material transformations, practice of maintenance, the rubbing up against restrictions, and the frictions felt from these actions can make room for joy, pleasure and abundance. How could Kennedy wiggling the nose of the expanding foam can into the ticket machine to make room for crip time in a car park, bring joy to not only him, but also to others who were visiting that day. Those who now did not need to rush, or keep in-line and on time? These friction-enabling experiences of crips slips beyond institutional and capitalist time and offers glimpses of a future we can wiggle into with and for one another. With \"access as friction\" we can embrace the struggles of making change where we need it, of getting in the way, and disorienting conversations and in doing so reconfiguring the infrastructures and institutions around us, possibly even with unknowable joy and pleasure.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to interdependence as political technology.\"\nIn the scoping of both feminist technoscience and the political/relational model of disability, how we work together around/for/with technology is itself a type of technology and method that we must orient around and practice. In crip technoscience and wider crip studies, there is a dedication to practising this through interdependence, focusing on how our capacities build up to together, and how we can make room for each other. What politics come from these places, what emerges from the ground up and can radically change the ways we imagine, embody and practice potential future politics now? One example Hamraie and Fritsch quote which resonates with this work is that of Mia Mingus's \"access intimacy\" (2017), which is hard to describe but easily felt. Access intimacy attends to how much someone 'gets' another's access needs, how they make room for them to express these feelings, even if it's stating you don't know what they are right now. Access intimacy as a concept makes room for me to imagine intimate ways of relating to others and how we can care for one another's access needs. It is to be open to the unknown and practice getting to know other's access needs.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to disability justice.\"\nManifesting crip technoscience that engages in disability rights goes beyond the assimilationist ideologies of mainstream accessibility to highlight how interconnected struggles, and finding justice in them, can make room for even more radical practices for crips within sociotechnical systems. When working for disability justice, crips refuse painful assistive technologies which only normalise their bodies to make others more comfortable. Disability justice also aligns this work with many intersections of disability studies to form a crip technoscience that is informed by and practices with working class, black, brown and indigenous disabled knowledges. It is one where we vouch for crip wholeness and life affirmation as places we can radically challenge the economics and politics of ableist powers that see us as broken or invalid. For this holding the impossible they turn to Eli Clare (2017), whose work suggests we can be broken and yet whole, imperfect, but valued, and holding a generative tension between the (not) opposites of these things.Hamraie and Fritsch also engage with the work of Sins Invalid and other crip artists and hackers to think through what Alice Sheppard (2019) calls \"cultural-aesthetic technoscience\". This is where they bring together new assemblages and aesthetics for communicating these complex relations of wholeness. Sins Invalid, for example, combine performance, technological aids and films doused in unashamed crip joy and pride, not hiding, but embracing and putting on show the potentials for love, grief and playfulness in a very serious but joyous space. As these thinkers and artists share, joy and pleasure are not the only way to achieve or approach disability justice as they can undermine the complex relations of disability globally, which work through oppression and debilitation as politics. Instead, engaging in and making room for this contradictory wholeness of disability justice is what shapes a crip technoscience that coalesces and dances with these sedimented tables through resistance. It is where I can build from the non-innocent, from the disabling continuation/aftermath of war, Big Tech extraction, petrochemical and medical industrial complex, to work with these embodied and plural crip experiences, knowledges and practices to form other ways of caring for each other, our technologies and our communities.<br>Crip manifestos are multiple in the ways that we can understand them coming together through action. They can move from stating principles for their organisation or community, such as Sins Invalid's 10 Principles of Disability Justice<a data-footref=\"r24\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html#fn-4-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, Johana Hedva's Access Rider (2019) and Healing Justice London's community agreements<a data-footref=\"r25\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.04_cripping_technoscience.html#fn-5-1a300d01f32e3b74_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a>.

These crip forms of manifesting, of making principles and agreements, of forming and imagining infrastructures and room we need now, and of telling stories of futures and relations with us in and yet to unfold, are what this research orients from. It inquires through how In my collaborations we can collectively imagine and action these other sets of politics, protocols and ways of relating from the sites of impact and friction. It is to make room for us to feel out from our embodied disorientations and towards community led technology. In this movement I have taken up disobedient action research as my methodology, as the next chapter highlights.

With this approach, the research makes room for my collaborators and I to be in touch with these network infrastructures. Doing this we focused on where we felt slips, slants, gaps and frictions to orient our approaches to the normative logics within computing. This was to question how these points of impact give us an ambivalent relation for us to imagine and practise crip futures from now. In coalescing Ahmed, Kafer, Hamraie and Fritsch, as well as many others, together in a crooked crip line for this chapter, I have formed a framework that aims to overflow from these sites of friction. This is to not avoid or invalidate these disconnects and misfittings, but to think through how they can inform other orientations from a position of radical Crip intersectionality, interdependence and disability justice. Working from these crip slants, naps and f(r)ictions are places that can build up our collective capacities for us to move off from the sedimented straight line of inheritance, break open the normative pipeline, and its determined relations, and make room for this research to question how my collaborators and I want to approach relational \"problems\" we are seated at together ourselves.To disorient these tables and relational norms I later turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a> as an axis of radical access, interdependence and coalition where I informed my practise and research.

This methodology and its iterating plurality of manifestings will unfold more throughout the thesis, but moves to put more digital network practice within reach of crip theory discourse. This is to think about how we can foster and centre crip practices and politics of radical care within our local community and collective configuration practices, but also to think about how these politics can overflow and make room and flexibility in these hard systems for other lines to be emegred elsewhere by others also facing their own frictions with efficient, white supremacist and curative politics. This approach aims to form collective politics that do not determine or prescribe methods and approaches, but makes room to contemplate how I as a collective technical practitioner can become intimate with collaborators access needs.

This chapter makes present how this work approaches this crip table and axis and inquire into analyse the institutional tables I am engaged in as a disabled practitioner and researcher. It gives some depth to why these tables have been impossible for me to approach as a crip, let alone get a grip on. This isn't because the physical institutional setup have barriers that stops me from accessing them, nor does my chronic health often debilitate me, and fortunately my care system somewhat validates my disability<a data-footref=\"x1\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-10e2fbfbedb6f35a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Nor is it that I am incapable of doing \"quality\" research. It is because of the political/relations of these institutions that burn me (out) every time I am in touch with them. It is because when I come to these tables they cut away at my capacities. Here, as I will go on to discuss further, I am thinking with Ahmed's notation of sedimentation and the determined orientations of work that result in repetitive strain injury (RSI) from bodies being held in place, and which reinforce work to break them before they start.<br>When I come to these institutional tables I am neither willing nor able to follow these exhaustive straight paths they set, as with my fatigue I will need a nap on route, maybe make a stew, go for a walk to digest and take a bath to replenish and care for my bodymind. By the time I am ready and able, the path has often grown over, or I might have forgotten exactly what I was doing or where I am (going)<a data-footref=\"x2\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-2-10e2fbfbedb6f35a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These crip lines are deviating orientations of survival and of life affirmation. What does it mean to be able to lay with these very queer and crip paths? Where can we hold this crip stuff and make times that celebrate them as places of generative access in conversation, instead of invalidating, problematising and backgrounding them from the tables where they have always been present but \"hidden from view\"?Through discussing these backgrounds this chapter acts as the positioning statement of the research. It aims to contextualise the research within queer and crip theory, specifically Sara Ahmed's work (2006) on Queer Phenomenology; Alison Kafer's work (2013; 2017; 2021; 2023) on crip time, her political/relational model of disability, and her crazed crip manifestings. I also orient this towards my focus of technoscience with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Manifesto (2019), Hamraie's wider work of access friction and access knowledge. This framework is used throughout the thesis to not only frame the analysis but also situate the work from my experiences of institutional relations to access, computing and care as a crip &amp; trans teacher, coder, collective instigator and researcher. Following Sara Ahmed I aim to offer an approach to how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (2006), specifically how this shaping takes place when approaching accessible futures for crip and disabled folks at the institutional tables of research, computing and collective practice. Building from Ahmed's figure and framework of the table as an \"orientation device\" this chapter asks what are these tables I am approaching, and why do I (often) retreat instead of taking a seat? It makes room to question what the normative and inherited political/relations of these institutional tables are, and how crip as method and situated experience, practice and knowledges makes room for us to imagine, coalesce, disorient and manifest other collective tables into being.<br>This framework held in parallel with the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> chapter, forms an orientation for this research that proposes crip manifestings, manifestos, protocols and infrastructures as a way to re-orient the norms of computational practices through a cripping disorientation. This disorientation asking us to refuse the pull, the heckles and obligations of tech practices and to listen to our own crip and queer axes, ones of life affirmation and radical relational politics, to form our own deviating lines that fit our collective and community bodily horizons instead of cutting away at them. This thesis draws other lines of survival, of necessity and of crip movement making, where we refuse orientations of tables and relations that aim to break bodies before they begin. Instead, it seeks to form practices to manifest together orientations and movements that can turn these tables towards stories of collective liberation and care. <br>As some disabilities are invalidated, or indeterminate within medicine, often leading to some of the most exhausting and painful experiences, that are still somehow invalidated.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-1-10e2fbfbedb6f35a_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>No matter who I am.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-2-10e2fbfbedb6f35a_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 02.01.00_Orienting_the_table<br>In Ahmed's Queer Phenenology, she keenly defines orientation<a data-footref=\"13\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-3c64f020e6afa905_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> as a way to situate the dialogue of direction. This move changes the scoping from a generalised and centralised dictation of direction that wider modernist philosophy denotes, to a situated and relational navigation of bodies. She does this by queering Husserl's figure of a table, his orientation towards it and his knowing of what is behind him as he does so (Ibid, 29). To do this she positions his back, and backgrounding of things, as the point of deviation that a queer phenomenology takes up in its analysis. At this inversion of direction and position sits the ability to wonder what is behind, to meander and imagine otherwise. Ahmed calls this \"turning the tables\"<a data-footref=\"14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-2-3c64f020e6afa905_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, where we situate a table by letting its background sink in and by caring for the work and maintenance that is often ''hidden from view\"(Ibid, 63) to make room for these queer, crip, social and domestic tables to be generative discourses within research and knowledge creation. This is where tables become many, where they deviate from straight standardised and projected 'known' formulas and become complex assemblages, with histories, sedimentations and horizons.<br>The \"bodily horizon\"(Ibid, 55) is key to understanding Ahmed's figure, as it asks, what do we orient ourselves towards? What do we bring towards ourselves from our horizon, and what objects do we let slip from view and out of reach? When we acknowledge we have limits to our perception, that we cannot see the whole environment, image or figure, we must be in a context. Ahmed's horizon queers phenomenology's horizon and encourages us to consider our own orientation, situate ourselves within our bodily horizon of social and domestic relations and ask which orientations of space make our bodies feel out of place. With Nirmal Puwar's 'Space Invaders', Ahmed shows how non-white bodies in places oriented for white bodies makes them feel \"out of place\" (Ibid, 133). She says that these bodies are disoriented by the society and people around them: \"people blink and then look again\" (Ibid, 135). For her this disorientation is a queer slanting of space, disorientations of bodies and that of bodies into objects. Ahmed poses disorientation<a data-footref=\"15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-3-3c64f020e6afa905_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as the point of failure, in which a body is placed into a form with which they do not fit, where they are objectified, and their needs are held out of reach.When we \"feel out of place\" and disorientation is the norm, Ahmed poses the movement of being in retreat, of moving away from, whilst facing. In this retreat, she says, there is queer joy as we look back at a past fading, into a future which can make room for \"the condition of possibility for another way of dwelling in the world\" (Ibid, 178). In feeling out of place at, disoriented by and in retreat from institutional tables this research(er) asks what it means to move within reach of another way of dwelling at these tables of computation, collaboration and institution, and specifically one that cares for and affirms crip and queer lives, experiences and knowledges. <br>\"Adding ''orientation'' to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position.\" (Ahmed 2006, 12)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-1-3c64f020e6afa905_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"In a way, a queer phenomenology is involved in the project of ''turning the tables'' on phenomenology by turning toward other kinds of tables.

Such tables, when turned, would come to life as something to think ''with'' as well as ''on.'\" (Ahmed 2006, 63)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-2-3c64f020e6afa905_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Disorientation involves failed orientations: bodies inhabit spaces that do not extend their shape, or use objects that do not extend their reach.

She makes an analogy here with a lump on her finger from where she grips her pen, where her finger has built up and sedimented its form in relation to the pen. Ahmed sums it up simply as \"what we ''do do'' affects what we ''can do.''\" (Ibid, 59). She refuses the hegemonic causality of a focus on doing as a singular straight direction. Instead, she suggests orientation is an expanding of a certain direction, that may relationally restrict others, but is not determinative. Her definition makes it possible for orientations and their sedimentations to not be singular in focus, and to make room form them to be navigated and approached within complex relations on our horizons and to take queer paths between them. When this approach arrives at the regressive mono-logics of institutional efficiencies, it disobediently opens up the many other paths and directions that are contingent.<br>Ahmed also discusses RSI as a potential effect of inheritance, sedimentation, time, repetition, and the determined table. RSI is the strain and pain caused from bodies repetitively conforming to a tables that does not care for them and figures them to be disabled before they begin. Here, bent over, hunched and aching as I work, in this cramped spot, is the perfect time to stretch out into Ahmed's queering of orientation. With RSI, I overtly feel how my body wants to be orientated<a data-footref=\"16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-005c46e2be027393_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, but I am contorted by inflexible hard systems, infrastructures and relations, through an institutional table that can only orientate my towards an ideology of efficient work. Through a queer orientation, Ahmed prompts me to listen to my bodies, my aches and my axes, to feel what I tend towards or need to retreat from.<br>It is helpful to question these relations of RSI through Ahmed's concept of inheritance<a data-footref=\"17\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-2-005c46e2be027393_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, thinking through not only where these projections of contorted bodies and relations have come from, but also what they perpetuate. What are the horizons of these inherited relations, and what is reachable from these positions? When the straight/atomic home is orientated so that there is a \"requirement that we bring home the \"other sex\" ... ''same race\"\" (Ibid, 127), then it is orientated to be self-perpetuating, autopoetic, and demanding a \"good likeness\". This orientation of a home demands that everyone be \"in line\" and maintain the norms and order of things, making sure that the relations and hierarchies \"line up\" between generations. Ahmed gives an example of drawing on tracing paper, copying lines over, and the sophisticated apparatus that philosophers, researchers, designers and institutional tables maintain to keep lines straight by \"holding\" things in place. These institutional apparatuses often smooth over any lumps, bumps, pains and aches that could queer the line and make it deviate. With Ahmed's approach I am empowered in some ways when I am disoriented by these enforced, inherited and sedimented lines, as this disorientation is a generative position of sense making, and to re-orient towards other tables and practices to sediment new queer and crip lines of affinity. <br>Mine is often in bed.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-1-005c46e2be027393_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Such an inheritance can be rethought in terms of orientations: we inherit the reach ability of some objects, those that are ''given'' to us or at least are made available to us within the family home.\" (Ahmed 2006, 126)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-2-005c46e2be027393_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 02.01.02_Queering_the_axis<br>To queer this sedimented straightening axis, Ahmed starts by tracing the etymology of \"queer\". Queer in a spatial context means a twist in space, and when we combine this with definitions of sexual orientation, it poses a bent, deviant or crooked sexuality. Ahmed starts to queer the straight line to make wiggle room to thinking about how to approach relations on this horizon. If we are to move straight towards an object, as a singular other from determinate positions, then we can only take a straight path towards it<a data-footref=\"x8\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-d6efbb9518de4027_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. She demonstrates this at the dining table where one man sits opposite one woman. This emerges into the family table where we have set sides and positions. Ahmed shows how this line straightens out a queer or crooked one by pushing us to choose one side of the table. Ahmed questions how the queer line is portrayed as oblique when held against the straight line, even posing that the straight line needs the queer one against which to appear comparatively straight. Ahmed reorients this idea through her figure of the \"contingent lesbian\" (Ibid, 92), which queers Freud's notion of a \"contingent introvert\", who positions queerness as a lack of finding a partner of the other sex, and so turns to her own by default. Ahmed inverts this relation to position straightness as contingent, and sees lesbians not as defaulting to queerness in the lack of a suitable person of the other sex, but defaulting to straightness and the other sex when the familial line and sedimented straight norms put queer bodies out of reach. Here she is thinking about this not as a \"coming out\" as queer or lesbian but as \"coming to\" queerness through desire. This reorients these relations towards queer desire and away from the \"requirement\" of a straight line. This makes room for me to understand how I approach the world along my own crooked or deviant lines that take me towards different people, communities, relations and in doing so shape my body and sediment my own paths.<br>Key to this critique is a queer reading of Merleau-Ponty's \"sensitive body\"<a data-footref=\"x9\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-2-d6efbb9518de4027_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> where Ahmed reflects on how inhabiting space produces a space to be inhabited. For example, a soft bottom creates a softer seat, that creates a softer bottom and softer seat. This concept is used to figure how a queer twist in the straight line of inheritance is itself conducive to forming a line that has room and capacity to be twisted. To think this through, she takes up the butch-femme dynamic of lesbian relations, and critiques not only the hetero perception of needing sexual difference or an opposite to attract but also queer critiques like Joan Nestle's \"phony heterosexual replicas\" that mimic this. With the help of Judith Butler she poses that the real need here is to question the necessity for difference in queer attraction, of the \"requirements\" of desire and relations. Ahmed instead positions these roles as performances as \"erotic possibilities that can generate new lines of desire only when they are just that: possibilities rather than requirements\" (Ibid, 99). In doing this she is opening up the possibility for bodies to not be determined by set relations but to be things to be desired, pursued, subverted and felt out. In this move she plays on lesbian fictions of Butch-Butch relations within Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues as well as Lee Lynch's The Swashbuckler, to show the comical navigation of desire of self within lesbian culture. She turns here though to state that these performed lines and bodily horizons of butch-femme are not illegitimate, but cautions against drawing \"a dividing line\" that can in itself \"make other forms of sexual desire unlivable\"(Ibid, 99). In this research, I have been playing with these ideas around queer relations in the context of wider intimacies, from how roles such as users and experts are performed with digital network infrastructures, to the emerging of indeterminate collaborative and collective desires.Ahmed takes Merleau-Ponty's notion of the \"sensitive body\" to discuss how this \"coming to\" queerness shapes and forms our bodies through being in relation with and touching other queer bodies. She explains how being oriented towards other women doesn't just shape our sexuality, but also what other objects are reachable on our horizon. She shares how queer and lesbian desires move us sideways, taking us to different associations and connections that are often invisible to others. As I follow my own queer path she encourages the refusal of this straightening up, to not look back or reorient ourselves to/around straight heckles, however offensive they are, and to instead orient towards my own queer promise. This queering of the axis is to stay disoriented, to orient into possibilities that straight lines could never map, and to touch and hold our bodies in our own economies. A queer axis is one where the horizontal and vertical lines of inheritance don't always \"line up\", can be \"off line\", and challenge the sedimentations that hold me in place, force me to one side and keep me out of reach of me needs and desires.<br>Removing the \"holding\" things in place, in this research when I move this metaphorical tracing paper to other tables and relations; the grooves in these different tables inducing a queering that animates these sedimented lines to be drawn otherwise. This means that if I take a seat at institutional tables as a crip and queer<a data-footref=\"x10\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-3-d6efbb9518de4027_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, even if it isn't orientated, approachable or stable to me, I am mutually affecting it. It means that when I bring myself, my thoughts and research to other queer tables, of coalition and of crip care, I can be comfy in our shared disorientation at hegemonic tables. The research I am doing gets slanted with my body to my other queerer axes. When I come to institutional tables along these queer axes, I take them off balance, grasping at them and nudging them to an orientation I need. This is a very queer dance that begins to happen when I refuse to be held in place, or hold other things out of place. I start to be able to be flexible in how I orient myself, begin to be able to feel my needs and to form tables and relations of affinity that feel mutual, constitutive and affective. <br>\"The straight line would be that which moves without any deviation toward the\"point\" of heterosexual union or sexual coupling: any acts that postpone the heterosexual union are perverse, which thus includes heterosexual practices that are not \"aimed\" toward penetration of the vagina by the penis\"(Ahmed 2006, 78)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fnref-1-d6efbb9518de4027_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"At the same time that we acknowledge this risk of universalism, we could queer Merleau-Ponty's ''sensitive body,'' or even suggest that such a body is already queer in its sensitivity ''to all the rest.''

In queering the axis and the paths I take, I can think through what it means to not always know the path, to get lost and connect things that aren't together when they are held in place by sedimented norms. For Ahmed, potential naivety around the proper way of doing things is a place of production where queer lines are drawn and other paths are made. This means that there is great strength in holding on to these institutional tables, however much they may try to throw you off, or move apart. By being there, and by making wiggle room<a data-footref=\"x11\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-d6c4a6b3b98f2b33_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, wiggling tables together and apart, I create the room I need to move towards the queer lines and modes of orientation that I desire. This room to breathe offer me the capacity to touch, feel out and imagine what my needs are and what paths may make these possible. Where do I have to move to be in reach of these needs and desires? Through transdisciplinarity I have the agency to imagine and practice what combinations of lines, what muddling of methods and disassociation of discipline makes the room for the change I need now. Much like Ahmed's navigation of butch-femme dynamics, transdisciplinarity is not meant to de-legitimise disciplinary fields or sedimented relations, but is meant to approach them as performances of knowledge and practices. Orienting disciplines in this way means that I can start to make room for what was once \"unlivable\" in disciplines' inherited terms. Again, this approach in its disobedience doesn't outright discredit the disciplines it works with but asks how their performed orientations may cross and transpose one another, what that could put in reach, and how making disciplines touch in other ways reshapes the bodily horizons of the disciplines themselves. This moves the focus from boundaries to orientations and how I can trace situated queer paths between disciplinary lines for myself. In this research, I bring together and move across fields of queer feminism, crip theory, critical access, disability justice, STS, media studies, information studies, artistic/creative practice, and software studies, to ask how a crip network and collective organisational practices can be made live-able between the institutions of computing and academia that systematically invalidate disabled queer lives. <br>\"Sometimes that is what we struggle for: wiggle room; to have spaces to breathe.

Ahmed is in many ways an amazing commentator on disability and anti-ableism, but here I turn to Alison Kafer's table, and to her work with her Feminist, Queer, Crip. Kafer's formation of the Political/Relational model of disability, and discussion on Crip Time as a concept makes room for me to question through more focused crip lens how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (Ahmed, 2006). In doing so I am thinking through how politics and relations form and hold disability in place, and in turn how through community, interdependence and collective access in action can make room for disability's indeterminacy to manifest many other futures together. I also inquire into Kafer's figuring of crip time not only as a way to hold many indeterminate bodies, but also as a way to understand and navigate the scoping of actions taken in this research. I reflect on the many scales that collaborative labours take, especially around manifesting collective infrastructures, from the infinite small meetings and feelings that I could never capture, to scales of maintenance that could have ended yesterday, or could stretch beyond my lifetime. With this, I also slip onto Kafer's table the Crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) by Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch, to re-orient these dialogues towards social and technical infrastructures and science technology studies (STS). Here I orient the crip as a social and technical hacker, reforming and manifesting infrastructures through direct action, affective feedback and refusal that centre crip knowledge and experience within making and doing. With this I ask what does it take for crips to make and sit cozily at tables of disability justice, access and life affirmation within and around institutions and infrastructures of research, computation and care? I want to approach these questions with others, within our capacity, with passion, pleasure and joy, asking: where/how can we make room to imagine and practise other political relations of liberation and affirmation, now?!\n02.02.01_PoliticalRelational_ModelAlison Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip is a foundational work for understanding how disability can be analysed from a crip perspective and approach. It looks to complicate the way that disability is represented and mediated, moving on from both the medical model and social model of disability, to one that can hold the diversity of intersections queer and disabled bodies experience as well as making room to critique the wider implications of a cure narrative. In the medical model of disability, as Kafer notes, quoting Simi Linton, \"the proper approach to disability is to \"'treat' the condition and the person with the condition rather than 'treating' the social processes and policies that constrict disabled people's lives.\"\" (2013, 5). The medical model treats the sickness or \"abnormality\" of disabled people on an individual basis and in doing so ignores and invalidates the background to their potentially disabling social relation. In doing this the medical model also ignores the experiences of disabled people whose bodies are not only most affected by these orientations, but also have the affective and situated knowledges that are essential to their nuanced affirming care. The medical model sees that \"solving the problem of disability, then, means correcting, normalising, or eliminating the pathological individual\" (Ibid, 5). A cure here can mean returning to being \"able bodied\" but it can also be interpreted as society being cured of disabled bodies. This medical model draws a line that forces disabled people to one side, and off of the table systematically through isolating them from it financially (Ibid, 39), as well as through eugenic regimes of genetic selection (Ibid, 76) and curing ideologies of technological enhancement (Ibid, 107).A later and more accepted model within the disabled community is the social model, which aims to draw attention to the social aspects and the background of disability that the medical model invalidates. It does this through an 'impairment/disability' axis, which makes room to understand what a person is capable of and how a society/system can limit their abilities relationally. To do this the social model defines impairment as \"any physical or mental limitation\" (Ibid, 7) and argues that \"disability signals the social exclusions based on, and social meanings attributed to, that impairment\" (Ibid, 7). Kafer sums it up simply: \"impairments aren't disabling, social and architectural barriers are\" (Ibid, 7). This is in many ways generative for re-approaching disability's \"problems\", moving them from the individual to societal, infrastructural and political scales.With Susan Wendell, Kafer queries the social model by asking, \"how far one must be able to walk to be considered able-bodied\" (Ibid, 7). While seemingly simple, this question opens many political and relational queries. What are the geographies (are there smooth walkways on flat-ish land?), economics (could they afford the walking aid or pain relief tablets?) community relations (was their friend free and able to help, or community carer available?), politics (are their medications legal?) and infrastructures (were they able to connect to a community, was an input valid on a form?). These questions move the approach away from a standardised test on an individual, and into understanding the nuances of disabling political dynamics on people's abilities, relationally and societally. Wendell and Kafer consider both impairment and disability to be socially constructed, as bodies are only seen as disabled in relation to sedimented \"able\" ones. Returning to Ahmed, we could ask how Crips line up to the determinate straight able-bodied line or axis? And Crips would probably respond, \"huh? what axis?\", or, maybe on another day, feeling more provocative, \"We don't have to!\"Kafer also notes that the social model, when taken to an extreme, inverts the orientation of the medical model, and in doing so can invalidate people with disabilities. An example is of those disabled people who acknowledging their pain or other impairments may have a desire for a cure to them, but this in the social model could be read as playing into the medical models' narrative of a cure they are trying to counter. In this inversion it can also overlook the fact that some disabilities, such as chronic health, pain and fatigue, will not change no matter how much we change social relations. Along this thread the social model also negates to contemplate how a cure narrative towards a particular (abled) kind of body can affect people who might not identify as disabled or be \"impaired\". Kafer gives the examples of anti-ageing creams that can play on the anxieties of getting old as well as growth hormones for shorter children to make them \"normal\" height. Both can be understoon as ableist and reliant on a curative model. From this orientation, we can understand how the social model orients disability to be delineated along fine lines, and in many ways undermines the radical knowledges of disabled experiences and the relations they can put in reach.Kafer proposes the political/relational model to reorient the social model's impairment/disability axis. Kafer's model asks what immediate changes to relations not only validate, but also ease and make room to build up the capacities of people living with experiences of disability, neurodiversity, chronic illness and pain \"under any circumstances\" (Ibid, 41), which I go on to discuss further in the next section on Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures.In action, navigating disability through these models can be quite sad, as we understand how overwhelming these social and institutional politics and pressures are on our crip bodyminds, and how violent, forceful and invalidating they are in action. However, by making room to navigate and analyse these institutional tables and their bodily horizons from a crip orientation, we are able to set out our own paths to move around the sinkholes and vacuums they hold in place to erase our lives, experiences and voices from the discourse about disabled people and our place in the future. In this research this takes the form of questioning how I have collectively organise around and with technology, away from curative narratives of efficiency and control within these institutional politics, and instead towards collective care, maintenance and access towards our own crip social and technical infrastructures.\n02.02.02_Crip_Time_+_Crip_Futures\n\"Can we tell crip tales, crip time tales, with multiple befores and afters, proliferating befores and afters, all making more crip presents possible?\" (Kafer 2021, 418)\n<br>One of the focuses of Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip and her wider research is her figuring out of crip time. Crip time is manifested by many different people in crip theory, from Ellen Samuel's Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time (2017), to Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011, p.&nbsp;62) which offers generative affective definitions, to Kafer's After Crip, Crip Afters (2021) and David P. Terry's Explanation not Excuse (2016) that poetically describe crip times. Prioritizing Crip Futures (Abrams et al., 2024) and Sins Invalid's Crip Kinship of Sins Invalid (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;75) also offer crip time in action in institutional and crip collective contexts. Crip time here makes room for a paradoxical and non-linear temporality that aims to sit with disabled people's bodies and experiences on their terms instead of enforcing a normative able-bodied orientation of time<a data-footref=\"x12\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-4330e3b5c03350ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. In essence, crip time is the refusal of determinate, straight, evenly-paced timelines. I choose to build from Kafer's definitions because of her emphasis on the systemic and political relations of temporalities that freeze and hold crips and disabled folks in place, as well as the ways we can hack and form wiggle room within these dominant hegemonic times. Kafer builds up her definition through a few moves but starts by cripping Lee Edelman's queer time against the future (Kafer 2013, 28). Here she takes up the figure of the 'Child' as a symbol of the future that in queer theory is often also a symbol of the deterministic straight line of inheritance towards able straight futures<a data-footref=\"x13\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-2-4330e3b5c03350ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. The figure of the Child is also heavily bound to the histories of eugenics, which conflated disabled, racialised, poor and indigenous bodies into the categories \"feeble-minded\" or \"defective\", and used to justify forced sterilisation or euthanasia for the future of the \"race\" (Ibid, 30). The legacies of these eugenic logics persist in contemporary prenatal selection and abortion of disabled children to \"solve\" the problem before it starts, and which the UK has re-enitiated this year (Maia Davies 2025). This emphasis on the future reinforces the endless deferral of care for disabled folks, that instead of making room and capacity to care for them now, orients funding to cure society and futures of their disabled bodies. One example Kafer takes up is of Noam Ostrander's interviews with young black men in Chicago with violently acquired spinal cord injuries (Ibid, 33). She highlights this case as it not only shows how the violent relations through which these men became disabled are so sedimented that their disabling was treated as inevitable, but also that becoming disabled was a foreclosure on their life, and one that determined them to have no future. Here she is sharing how disability is imagined by ableism to have no future, and that to authoritarian eugenics logics, reinforced through race, class, sexuality, gender identity and more, determine disability as a category to forcibly place bodies that they do not want to see in the future.In her book Kafer engages with the figure of the \"Child\" to disorient dialogues around disabled bodies that do not seem to fit in hegemonic futures. She does this by inquiring into both disabled peoples abilities to procreate more disabled bodies (children), as well as exploring the capacities disabled people have to procreate culture, social relations and intimacies. By doing so, she questions the hegemonic terms through which disability's futures are represented. She elaborates on this by studying both mainstream media narratives playing out these political imaginaries and contemporary social and technical infrastructures that reinforce these ableist politics systemically.For example, Kafer reads Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time, and its legacy within feminist studies as a text that demonstrates \"inclusivity\" and political democracy within science (Ibid, 72). Through a crip lens, Kafer's analysis shows it is anything but inclusive or democratic. This Utopian world has in fact eradicated all disabled people without any mention or dialogue that included them. The fictive society is in many ways Utopian because it has eradicated disabled people through genetic science and technological advancement. The fictive infrastructure that has enabled this is called the brooder, which mixes and selects genes to form neutral healthy children of all races, but in doing so eradicates disabled bodies without question. In the same move it also blends and displaces race as a way to cure us of cultural difference and racial inequality. When held in comparison to the depicted Dystopia, which is filled with disabled and mad bodyminds, it shares how disabled people's existence here represents one of the main signifies of this utopian/dystopian split. Beyond the macro of this split, the only mention of disability in the utopia is of people taking mental health breaks, where they drop out from society. This in many ways still enacts the erasure of disability from society, put to one side, siloed and hidden from sight until normal or cured. Through Kafer's analysis she shows how neither the utopian nor dystopian futures make room for or imagine disabled people to live full lives, or affirm their experiences. In these futures disabled people are either the abundant problem or are silently cured from existence as part of the solution. In these narratives, disabled bodies, feelings and experiences are not included in the making of futures. In utopia, they have been invalidated and backgrounded at every step towards this \"greater good\".<br>In response I have shared how Kafer constructs a crip time that makes room to hold the affective, embodied and experiential relations to time that disabled bodies have the capacity to feel. This affective crip relation to time emerges through disabling relations to institutions, systems and infrastructures, or just how disabled bodyminds queerly move through and experience time and space<a data-footref=\"x14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-3-4330e3b5c03350ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. Kafer presents many forms of crip time, from the slowing down and indefinite postponing of care, to the immediacy of when we need to care right now. Crip time takes the form of cycles of time that complicate the normative straight cycles of the able-bodied clock, and disables people from accessing in-flexible institutions, financial stability and self-determinacy.Kafer aligns crip time with Jack Halberstam's discussion of queer time, in particular the \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\" of queer life (Ibid, 35). For Halberstam,the immediacy of the AIDS crisis, specifically for gay men and their communities took them out of mainstream and normative time, to a time of \"the here, the present, the now\" (Ibid, 35). In crip contexts, Kafer describes a \"falling time\". Falling ill or getting a prognosis changes perceptions of time, shrinks futures and intensifies the present. When falling into depression, time is slowed to a stop, yet can fly by. How does time feel when there are uncertainties as to whether a chemical, food or unpredictable trigger could induce symptoms that will take you out of time? These fallings into \"strange temporalities\" leaves space for disabled people to feel these times as they are and not line-up to a straight and normative time, validating and enabling crip bodies to tell stories that can change how we think with time.For \"imaginative life schedules\" Kafer brings to the forefront the ways that disabled people have to pre-plan and hack systems of care to be in reach of their needs. How partners and friends need to split carers and medicines, as systems have valued one over the other. How families and friends need to fill the gaps. How bathroom visits have to be pre-planned and scheduled. Kafer poses these \"imaginative life schedules\" not just as the extenuated day to day planning that most disabled people take on, but as the need to project crip bodies into the future to maintain them. This maintenance is highlighted not just as (re)production that we see within efficiency models, but as pleasurable acts of each day, and towards unknown practices of radical access. These schedules then become a place with a possibility of joy for organising and maintaining embodied futures for disabled lives that resist the violence of institutional and hegemonic determination of disabled futures.With \"eccentric economic practices\" Kafer talks about the ways that crip people are economic hackers. When the lines of systemic and institutional care don't hold you and you start to slip through. When they limit how much you can earn to maintain your care subsidies and determine you into a certain level of (dis)comfort. This is when these eccentric economics are necessitated and practised, to trade goods, favours and pleasures under the radar so that crips don't compromise our basic needs and care. These economics for Kafer this offers a blurring of the public/private in a way that makes room for these economics to be a test bed for us to imagine what crip politics in action might be capable of. This is where our everyday practices of collective access and interdependence become radical methods for rethinking the politics of how we come together and table, or put to bed our differences.<br>Kafer's situates crip time between a time of falling in the here and now, meanwhile maintaining our bodies to enact a future with us in it by practising politics of our everyday. Kafer goes on to examine how this framing of crip time lines up against narratives of longevity, focusing on cripping Halberstam's notion of keeping going \"under any circumstances\"<a data-footref=\"x15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-4-4330e3b5c03350ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>. In a queer refusal of longevity, hegemony is understood to reproduce deterministic futures indefinitely. A crip position instead sits with each situated body differently. Kafer asks what it means for that or this body to keep going \"under any circumstance\"<a data-footref=\"x16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-5-4330e3b5c03350ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a>, and how can we ease the institutional and social pressures that curtail crip life at every turn. Here she is moving to also step out of line and inquire, \"what are the circumstances we need but also desire?\", and by asking this, also asking how to orient them to be within reach.\n02.02.03_Crip_intersectionalityThe Crip relation to intersectionality is one of the most radical approaches to the term, as it is so abundant and overflowing. This is due to the variety of bodies, experiences and struggles that exist under the broad terms of disability. Of course we can turn to Kimberly Crenshaw's definition of intersectionality(Crenshaw 1991; 2015), and it's emergence from groups like the Combahee River Collective, where \"interlocking oppressions\" form at the cross roads of identities. This in many ways comes from and speaks to disability (even if it is not overtly stated), but I find it more interesting to look at definitions that come from the overt practices of crip studies. This Crip kinship (2021) as Shayda Kafai would term it, is where the abundance of crip communities and interdependence of intersections shine. Kafai's book centres on the practices of Sins Invalid, a crip performance group started by Patty Berne and Leroy Moore. Sins Invalid's work centres expressing crip pleasures, joy and desire without shame and through interdependence. The group's definition of intersectionality is one that I hold dear in my research and repeatedly reflect on in my practice.\n\"Sins Invalid defines intersectionality this way: \"Simply put, this principle says that we are many things, and they all impact us. We are not only disabled, we are also each coming from a specific experience of race, class, sexuality, age, religious background, geographic location, immigration status, and more. Depending on context, we all have areas where we experience privilege, as well as areas of oppression... We gratefully embrace the nuance that this principle brings to our lived experiences, and the ways it shapes the perspectives we offer.\"\" (Ibid, 31)\nThis definition of intersectionality by Sins Invalid has helped me to think through how I can come together with collaborators to practice crip freedoms together. To treat these intersections with care and situate our capacities, privileges and desires into and out of alignment. Kafer also notes Robert McRuer's notion of \"the non-disabled claim to be crip\" (2013, p.&nbsp;169), which I follow: the possibility of able bodied crips, of those working for the disabled cause, but also maybe those that recognise the \"the disability to come.\" Committing to this wider scope of intersectional disability justice is a key step for any crip studies critique, as accessibly explained in Ella Parry-Davies' Coming out Crip (2022) audio piece. She, much like myself, is only \"stable\" because we live in the UK with a state health system that recognises our needs, and can \"treat\" them in its medical scoping of our conditions. If we were to live elsewhere, have different nationalities and the relational support those bodies have, we might not even be here, or able to make these statements. With this we embed ourselves within the mutual cause against all intersecting injustices towards disability.In this dialogue privilege and oppression are situated and negotiated both with intimacy. With this I have asked how can I as a white crip researcher, within academic institutions that are often inaccessible to other intersections of disabled people, use my privilege and oppression in this experience and context to leverage resources and change discourses to position disability justice and radical access as the next action I take at every turn? It also asks me to know that I will never know the experiences of other people with disability and to have patience and commitment, to get in touch with and to learn to communicate our collective sense making. It is to take our sweet crip ass time to get a feel for one another, and affirm each other along that path and journey.I find it important to think through intersectionality with Kafer's reading of Ashley-X's story. This is because it offers clearly the ways we have to defy the urge to divide disability through its diversity, but to instead centre and care for these bodies on the margins of our discourse. Ashley is born with \"static encephalopathy\", that leads her doctors to state that \"her development never progressed beyond that of an infant\", and means that she depends on constant care for her lifetime. The nickname by carers for the condition and similar disabilities is a \"pillow angel\". Another element of this relation is that her body developed at a \"normal\" pace, and at age 6 her parents started to be concerned about what puberty would do to her. From consultations with medical \"experts\" they set up a plan to remove Ashley's uterus and breast buds, as well as put here on a high dose oestrogen regime. The medical \"experts\" in dialogue with the parents validated this treatment for many reasons, from \"saving\" Ashley from pains of menopause and puberty, as well as keeping her small so her parents could care and protect her directly, as well as keeping her safe from her own mature body. This meant that the way Ashley and her body were unconsensually treated was to be shaped for the able bodied world around them. They just made her easy to handle as well as protected from relations held in place by ableist and violent sexist politics. I work with Kafer's reading of Ashley for a few reasons, partially as it highlights the ways disabled bodies and experiences are curtailed to fit the hard ableist systems, scales and needs, instead of considering the disabled bodymind's own needs, orientations and desires. It also shares the length that these sorts of ableist actions can be taken to, how far an individual who cannot oppose can be shaped to fit the efficient line, instead of questioning the political relations of the line itself. This is highlighted by some mixed views from both medicine and disability studies, whether a person like Ashley-X is too disabled to be disabled, and whether people like them need their own category (Kafer 2013, 67). This division provokes yet another boundary beyond the able/disabled projected axis, forming again new complex parameters that permit questionably dehumanising and violent treatments, such as the one Ashley-X recieved. Kafer asks here what if we place people like Ashley-X not outside of disability discourse, but in the centre of it? When I start to imagine relations and tables to care for these experiences and not determine and invalidate their communication ability, I open myself up to feel and be felt through many yet unknowable ways. Kafer's enactment of crip theory here also centres the joy of this communication. In Ashley-X's case, a double mastectomy and hormone blockers to stop her breasts growing means that Ashley was also disabled from having any pleasure from these removed organs. Their pleasure was never imagined, nor valued in their future, only pain. That just because these experts were did not have the capacity to feel Ashley's expressions of joy, imagine their bodily possibilities of pleasure and agency, or even contemplate their political desires meant that it was these experts who had invalidated Ashley without question or dialogue. Instead of joy or pleasure, the dialogues around Ashley's body focus on pain or discomfort and keeping her secure from strangers, who may also feel this discomfort around her. Reflecting on Ashley-X through crip intersectionality, it can also be understood that this probably only happened to her as she came from a middle class American family that could afford to treat her through these medical industrial institutions. When I highlight her context, I think to how I can build up capacities to be in dialogue with each other. This is also amplified by disability as such a diverse field that includes so many bodyminds in so many different situated social/political relations. Again a crip move is to centre joy and pleasure as an actionable site for us to move from, but this is not to say we silence or ignore the very real pain that exists everyday within our community internationally and intersectionally. It instead aims to move beyond deterministic narratives of disability as painful and awkward and asking what brings us together through joy, comfort and pleasure, even if we are dealing with pain, depression and disabling social relations. Through feeling out these restraints we can start to move towards interdependently asking/demanding how to put our desires in reach of one another?In Kafer's final chapter, 'Accessible Futures, Future Coalitions', she gives an example of Silvia Yee's work with the Disability rights education and Defense Fund (DreDF) (2013, p.&nbsp;160). Kafer highlights their work with communities facing the overburden of toxic industries and emissions to show how policy and access put in place to help disabled people in many ways benefits everyone. In the case of DreDF the rights of children with respiratory issues can stop schools and institutions from using potentially harmful chemical pesticides, which can benefit not only the quality of life of everyone in that district but also reduces the ecological impacts. This presents Crip intersectionality as a powerful place where in coalition we can leverage our communities access privileges to not only improve their individual lives but to put a future we all want into reach.This is where the interdependence of crips also sits as an essential practice. When disabled people struggle to perform as required by a system or to be valued the same as able-bodied people, communities have to help each other manage the gaps. Like I shared in Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures with Kafer's take on Halberstam's \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\", all of these crip times are threaded through community schedules, care and interdependence. These acts can range from just consolidating to each other that it is fine that we are sad and mad, that there are gaps in what we are able to do, and being there when we almost fall through them.<br>In the third episode of the Crip Club podcast<a data-footref=\"x18\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.html#fn-1-92941007c5f2c865_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> , which discusses disabled representation in films and media, Clare Baines interviews Jessi Gutch around cancer portrayals (Baines, o.&nbsp;J.). In the podcast they not only talk around what it means for Gutch to not fit into the curative narrative of cancer, but she also shares her experiences of living with a disability whilst working in the film industry. The section I felt was most informative for understandings of intersectionality and interdependence of disabled folk, is when she is talking about working in a majority disabled set. This crip background informed a very different set of expectations and capacities for one another. Gutch says that this formed a space where people could express their needs easily and have them affirmed, where everyone on set knew that this film was important, but not the most important thing. The most important thing is that everyone in this collaboration was feeling as good as they could in their bodyminds and able to do what they wanted to within the collaboration. It was where if they needed more time for this crip stuff they could have it without question.\n02.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience\n02.03.00_ConclusionThis chapter has shared how my research is orientated through a crip and queer approach that aims to trouble the sedimented ableist norms of computing practices and technoscience through a disobedient queer axis of disorienting collectice Crip manifestings. With this approach, the research makes room for my collaborators and I to be in touch with these network infrastructures. Doing this we focused on where we felt slips, slants, gaps and frictions to orient our approaches to the normative logics within computing. This was to question how these points of impact give us an ambivalent relation for us to imagine and practise crip futures from now. In coalescing Ahmed, Kafer, Hamraie and Fritsch, as well as many others, together in a crooked crip line for this chapter, I have formed a framework that aims to overflow from these sites of friction. This is to not avoid or invalidate these disconnects and misfittings, but to think through how they can inform other orientations from a position of radical Crip intersectionality, interdependence and disability justice. Working from these crip slants, naps and f(r)ictions are places that can build up our collective capacities for us to move off from the sedimented straight line of inheritance, break open the normative pipeline, and its determined relations, and make room for this research to question how my collaborators and I want to approach relational \"problems\" we are seated at together ourselves.<br>To disorient these tables and relational norms I later turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a> as an axis of radical access, interdependence and coalition where I informed my practise and research.

This crip axis makes room for this research to take on coalition, collective practice and of movement making as a core practice, thinking through how social relations of infrastructures are political technologies that we can coalesce (in) together.<br>Alongside <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a>, this chapter aims to provide fertile methodological ground for crip manifestings to be approached through disobedient actions and within computing. This methodology and its iterating plurality of manifestings will unfold more throughout the thesis, but moves to put more digital network practice within reach of crip theory discourse. This is to think about how we can foster and centre crip practices and politics of radical care within our local community and collective configuration practices, but also to think about how these politics can overflow and make room and flexibility in these hard systems for other lines to be emegred elsewhere by others also facing their own frictions with efficient, white supremacist and curative politics. This approach aims to form collective politics that do not determine or prescribe methods and approaches, but makes room to contemplate how I as a collective technical practitioner can become intimate with collaborators access needs. Here making wiggle room for us all to be experts, practitioners and knowers/makers of our own (life affirming) infrastructures, and in doing so gaining agency and capacities at the tables we have always been present at, but were never allowed to get to grips

Crip TableOrienting the TableTo queer this sedimented straightening axis, Ahmed starts by tracing the etymology of \"queer\". Queer in a spatial context means a twist in space, and when we combine this with definitions of sexual orientation, it poses a bent, deviant or crooked sexuality. Ahmed starts to queer the straight line to make wiggle room to thinking about how to approach relations on this horizon. If we are to move straight towards an object, as a singular other from determinate positions, then we can only take a straight path towards it<a data-footref=\"x8\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-6218886884f61a5a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. She demonstrates this at the dining table where one man sits opposite one woman. This emerges into the family table where we have set sides and positions. Ahmed shows how this line straightens out a queer or crooked one by pushing us to choose one side of the table. Ahmed questions how the queer line is portrayed as oblique when held against the straight line, even posing that the straight line needs the queer one against which to appear comparatively straight. Ahmed reorients this idea through her figure of the \"contingent lesbian\" (Ibid, 92), which queers Freud's notion of a \"contingent introvert\", who positions queerness as a lack of finding a partner of the other sex, and so turns to her own by default. Ahmed inverts this relation to position straightness as contingent, and sees lesbians not as defaulting to queerness in the lack of a suitable person of the other sex, but defaulting to straightness and the other sex when the familial line and sedimented straight norms put queer bodies out of reach. Here she is thinking about this not as a \"coming out\" as queer or lesbian but as \"coming to\" queerness through desire. This reorients these relations towards queer desire and away from the \"requirement\" of a straight line. This makes room for me to understand how I approach the world along my own crooked or deviant lines that take me towards different people, communities, relations and in doing so shape my body and sediment my own paths.<br>Key to this critique is a queer reading of Merleau-Ponty's \"sensitive body\"<a data-footref=\"x9\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-6218886884f61a5a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> where Ahmed reflects on how inhabiting space produces a space to be inhabited. For example, a soft bottom creates a softer seat, that creates a softer bottom and softer seat. This concept is used to figure how a queer twist in the straight line of inheritance is itself conducive to forming a line that has room and capacity to be twisted. To think this through, she takes up the butch-femme dynamic of lesbian relations, and critiques not only the hetero perception of needing sexual difference or an opposite to attract but also queer critiques like Joan Nestle's \"phony heterosexual replicas\" that mimic this. With the help of Judith Butler she poses that the real need here is to question the necessity for difference in queer attraction, of the \"requirements\" of desire and relations. Ahmed instead positions these roles as performances as \"erotic possibilities that can generate new lines of desire only when they are just that: possibilities rather than requirements\" (Ibid, 99). In doing this she is opening up the possibility for bodies to not be determined by set relations but to be things to be desired, pursued, subverted and felt out. In this move she plays on lesbian fictions of Butch-Butch relations within Leslie Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues as well as Lee Lynch's The Swashbuckler, to show the comical navigation of desire of self within lesbian culture. She turns here though to state that these performed lines and bodily horizons of butch-femme are not illegitimate, but cautions against drawing \"a dividing line\" that can in itself \"make other forms of sexual desire unlivable\"(Ibid, 99). In this research, I have been playing with these ideas around queer relations in the context of wider intimacies, from how roles such as users and experts are performed with digital network infrastructures, to the emerging of indeterminate collaborative and collective desires.Ahmed takes Merleau-Ponty's notion of the \"sensitive body\" to discuss how this \"coming to\" queerness shapes and forms our bodies through being in relation with and touching other queer bodies. She explains how being oriented towards other women doesn't just shape our sexuality, but also what other objects are reachable on our horizon. She shares how queer and lesbian desires move us sideways, taking us to different associations and connections that are often invisible to others. As I follow my own queer path she encourages the refusal of this straightening up, to not look back or reorient ourselves to/around straight heckles, however offensive they are, and to instead orient towards my own queer promise. This queering of the axis is to stay disoriented, to orient into possibilities that straight lines could never map, and to touch and hold our bodies in our own economies. A queer axis is one where the horizontal and vertical lines of inheritance don't always \"line up\", can be \"off line\", and challenge the sedimentations that hold me in place, force me to one side and keep me out of reach of me needs and desires.<br>Removing the \"holding\" things in place, in this research when I move this metaphorical tracing paper to other tables and relations; the grooves in these different tables inducing a queering that animates these sedimented lines to be drawn otherwise. This means that if I take a seat at institutional tables as a crip and queer<a data-footref=\"x10\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-6218886884f61a5a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, even if it isn't orientated, approachable or stable to me, I am mutually affecting it. It means that when I bring myself, my thoughts and research to other queer tables, of coalition and of crip care, I can be comfy in our shared disorientation at hegemonic tables. The research I am doing gets slanted with my body to my other queerer axes. When I come to institutional tables along these queer axes, I take them off balance, grasping at them and nudging them to an orientation I need. This is a very queer dance that begins to happen when I refuse to be held in place, or hold other things out of place. I start to be able to be flexible in how I orient myself, begin to be able to feel my needs and to form tables and relations of affinity that feel mutual, constitutive and affective. <br>\"The straight line would be that which moves without any deviation toward the\"point\" of heterosexual union or sexual coupling: any acts that postpone the heterosexual union are perverse, which thus includes heterosexual practices that are not \"aimed\" toward penetration of the vagina by the penis\"(Ahmed 2006, 78)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-1-6218886884f61a5a_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"At the same time that we acknowledge this risk of universalism, we could queer Merleau-Ponty's ''sensitive body,'' or even suggest that such a body is already queer in its sensitivity ''to all the rest.''

This move changes the scoping from a generalised and centralised dictation of direction that wider modernist philosophy denotes, to a situated and relational navigation of bodies. She does this by queering Husserl's figure of a table, his orientation towards it and his knowing of what is behind him as he does so (Ibid, 29). To do this she positions his back, and backgrounding of things, as the point of deviation that a queer phenomenology takes up in its analysis. At this inversion of direction and position sits the ability to wonder what is behind, to meander and imagine otherwise. Ahmed calls this \"turning the tables\"<a data-footref=\"14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-f68045963e57cbfa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, where we situate a table by letting its background sink in and by caring for the work and maintenance that is often ''hidden from view\"(Ibid, 63) to make room for these queer, crip, social and domestic tables to be generative discourses within research and knowledge creation. This is where tables become many, where they deviate from straight standardised and projected 'known' formulas and become complex assemblages, with histories, sedimentations and horizons.<br>The \"bodily horizon\"(Ibid, 55) is key to understanding Ahmed's figure, as it asks, what do we orient ourselves towards? What do we bring towards ourselves from our horizon, and what objects do we let slip from view and out of reach? When we acknowledge we have limits to our perception, that we cannot see the whole environment, image or figure, we must be in a context. Ahmed's horizon queers phenomenology's horizon and encourages us to consider our own orientation, situate ourselves within our bodily horizon of social and domestic relations and ask which orientations of space make our bodies feel out of place. With Nirmal Puwar's 'Space Invaders', Ahmed shows how non-white bodies in places oriented for white bodies makes them feel \"out of place\" (Ibid, 133). She says that these bodies are disoriented by the society and people around them: \"people blink and then look again\" (Ibid, 135). For her this disorientation is a queer slanting of space, disorientations of bodies and that of bodies into objects. Ahmed poses disorientation<a data-footref=\"15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-f68045963e57cbfa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as the point of failure, in which a body is placed into a form with which they do not fit, where they are objectified, and their needs are held out of reach.When we \"feel out of place\" and disorientation is the norm, Ahmed poses the movement of being in retreat, of moving away from, whilst facing. In this retreat, she says, there is queer joy as we look back at a past fading, into a future which can make room for \"the condition of possibility for another way of dwelling in the world\" (Ibid, 178). In feeling out of place at, disoriented by and in retreat from institutional tables this research(er) asks what it means to move within reach of another way of dwelling at these tables of computation, collaboration and institution, and specifically one that cares for and affirms crip and queer lives, experiences and knowledges. <br>\"Adding ''orientation'' to the picture gives a new dimension to the critique of the distinction between absolute space and relative space, also described as the distinction between location and position.\" (Ahmed 2006, 12)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-1-f68045963e57cbfa_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"In a way, a queer phenomenology is involved in the project of ''turning the tables'' on phenomenology by turning toward other kinds of tables.

In queering the axis and the paths I take, I can think through what it means to not always know the path, to get lost and connect things that aren't together when they are held in place by sedimented norms. For Ahmed, potential naivety around the proper way of doing things is a place of production where queer lines are drawn and other paths are made. This means that there is great strength in holding on to these institutional tables, however much they may try to throw you off, or move apart. By being there, and by making wiggle room<a data-footref=\"x11\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-e63557a544979ce0_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, wiggling tables together and apart, I create the room I need to move towards the queer lines and modes of orientation that I desire. This room to breathe offer me the capacity to touch, feel out and imagine what my needs are and what paths may make these possible. Where do I have to move to be in reach of these needs and desires? Through transdisciplinarity I have the agency to imagine and practice what combinations of lines, what muddling of methods and disassociation of discipline makes the room for the change I need now. Much like Ahmed's navigation of butch-femme dynamics, transdisciplinarity is not meant to de-legitimise disciplinary fields or sedimented relations, but is meant to approach them as performances of knowledge and practices. Orienting disciplines in this way means that I can start to make room for what was once \"unlivable\" in disciplines' inherited terms. Again, this approach in its disobedience doesn't outright discredit the disciplines it works with but asks how their performed orientations may cross and transpose one another, what that could put in reach, and how making disciplines touch in other ways reshapes the bodily horizons of the disciplines themselves. This moves the focus from boundaries to orientations and how I can trace situated queer paths between disciplinary lines for myself. In this research, I bring together and move across fields of queer feminism, crip theory, critical access, disability justice, STS, media studies, information studies, artistic/creative practice, and software studies, to ask how a crip network and collective organisational practices can be made live-able between the institutions of computing and academia that systematically invalidate disabled queer lives. <br>\"Sometimes that is what we struggle for: wiggle room; to have spaces to breathe.

She makes an analogy here with a lump on her finger from where she grips her pen, where her finger has built up and sedimented its form in relation to the pen. Ahmed sums it up simply as \"what we ''do do'' affects what we ''can do.''\" (Ibid, 59). She refuses the hegemonic causality of a focus on doing as a singular straight direction. Instead, she suggests orientation is an expanding of a certain direction, that may relationally restrict others, but is not determinative. Her definition makes it possible for orientations and their sedimentations to not be singular in focus, and to make room form them to be navigated and approached within complex relations on our horizons and to take queer paths between them. When this approach arrives at the regressive mono-logics of institutional efficiencies, it disobediently opens up the many other paths and directions that are contingent.<br>Ahmed also discusses RSI as a potential effect of inheritance, sedimentation, time, repetition, and the determined table. RSI is the strain and pain caused from bodies repetitively conforming to a tables that does not care for them and figures them to be disabled before they begin. Here, bent over, hunched and aching as I work, in this cramped spot, is the perfect time to stretch out into Ahmed's queering of orientation. With RSI, I overtly feel how my body wants to be orientated<a data-footref=\"16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-bbe35b3bbade3ed2_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, but I am contorted by inflexible hard systems, infrastructures and relations, through an institutional table that can only orientate my towards an ideology of efficient work. Through a queer orientation, Ahmed prompts me to listen to my bodies, my aches and my axes, to feel what I tend towards or need to retreat from.<br>It is helpful to question these relations of RSI through Ahmed's concept of inheritance<a data-footref=\"17\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-bbe35b3bbade3ed2_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, thinking through not only where these projections of contorted bodies and relations have come from, but also what they perpetuate. What are the horizons of these inherited relations, and what is reachable from these positions? When the straight/atomic home is orientated so that there is a \"requirement that we bring home the \"other sex\" ... ''same race\"\" (Ibid, 127), then it is orientated to be self-perpetuating, autopoetic, and demanding a \"good likeness\". This orientation of a home demands that everyone be \"in line\" and maintain the norms and order of things, making sure that the relations and hierarchies \"line up\" between generations. Ahmed gives an example of drawing on tracing paper, copying lines over, and the sophisticated apparatus that philosophers, researchers, designers and institutional tables maintain to keep lines straight by \"holding\" things in place. These institutional apparatuses often smooth over any lumps, bumps, pains and aches that could queer the line and make it deviate. With Ahmed's approach I am empowered in some ways when I am disoriented by these enforced, inherited and sedimented lines, as this disorientation is a generative position of sense making, and to re-orient towards other tables and practices to sediment new queer and crip lines of affinity. <br>Mine is often in bed.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-1-bbe35b3bbade3ed2_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Such an inheritance can be rethought in terms of orientations: we inherit the reach ability of some objects, those that are ''given'' to us or at least are made available to us within the family home.\" (Ahmed 2006, 126)<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-2-bbe35b3bbade3ed2_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n02.01.01_Sedimentation<br>Now is the time for me to try and approach a crip table. This chapter makes present how this work approaches this crip table and axis and inquire into analyse the institutional tables I am engaged in as a disabled practitioner and researcher. It gives some depth to why these tables have been impossible for me to approach as a crip, let alone get a grip on. This isn't because the physical institutional setup have barriers that stops me from accessing them, nor does my chronic health often debilitate me, and fortunately my care system somewhat validates my disability<a data-footref=\"x1\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-fd31ed079f01a166_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Nor is it that I am incapable of doing \"quality\" research. It is because of the political/relations of these institutions that burn me (out) every time I am in touch with them. It is because when I come to these tables they cut away at my capacities. Here, as I will go on to discuss further, I am thinking with Ahmed's notation of sedimentation and the determined orientations of work that result in repetitive strain injury (RSI) from bodies being held in place, and which reinforce work to break them before they start.<br>When I come to these institutional tables I am neither willing nor able to follow these exhaustive straight paths they set, as with my fatigue I will need a nap on route, maybe make a stew, go for a walk to digest and take a bath to replenish and care for my bodymind. By the time I am ready and able, the path has often grown over, or I might have forgotten exactly what I was doing or where I am (going)<a data-footref=\"x2\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-fd31ed079f01a166_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These crip lines are deviating orientations of survival and of life affirmation. What does it mean to be able to lay with these very queer and crip paths? Where can we hold this crip stuff and make times that celebrate them as places of generative access in conversation, instead of invalidating, problematising and backgrounding them from the tables where they have always been present but \"hidden from view\"?Through discussing these backgrounds this chapter acts as the positioning statement of the research. It aims to contextualise the research within queer and crip theory, specifically Sara Ahmed's work (2006) on Queer Phenomenology; Alison Kafer's work (2013; 2017; 2021; 2023) on crip time, her political/relational model of disability, and her crazed crip manifestings. I also orient this towards my focus of technoscience with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Manifesto (2019), Hamraie's wider work of access friction and access knowledge. This framework is used throughout the thesis to not only frame the analysis but also situate the work from my experiences of institutional relations to access, computing and care as a crip &amp; trans teacher, coder, collective instigator and researcher. Following Sara Ahmed I aim to offer an approach to how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (2006), specifically how this shaping takes place when approaching accessible futures for crip and disabled folks at the institutional tables of research, computing and collective practice. Building from Ahmed's figure and framework of the table as an \"orientation device\" this chapter asks what are these tables I am approaching, and why do I (often) retreat instead of taking a seat? It makes room to question what the normative and inherited political/relations of these institutional tables are, and how crip as method and situated experience, practice and knowledges makes room for us to imagine, coalesce, disorient and manifest other collective tables into being.<br>This framework held in parallel with the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> chapter, forms an orientation for this research that proposes crip manifestings, manifestos, protocols and infrastructures as a way to re-orient the norms of computational practices through a cripping disorientation. This disorientation asking us to refuse the pull, the heckles and obligations of tech practices and to listen to our own crip and queer axes, ones of life affirmation and radical relational politics, to form our own deviating lines that fit our collective and community bodily horizons instead of cutting away at them. This thesis draws other lines of survival, of necessity and of crip movement making, where we refuse orientations of tables and relations that aim to break bodies before they begin. Instead, it seeks to form practices to manifest together orientations and movements that can turn these tables towards stories of collective liberation and care. <br>As some disabilities are invalidated, or indeterminate within medicine, often leading to some of the most exhausting and painful experiences, that are still somehow invalidated.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-1-fd31ed079f01a166_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>No matter who I am.<a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-2-fd31ed079f01a166_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n02.00_Intro<br>For \"cripping\" technology, Cielo Saucedo and Nat Decker's Cripping_Computer_Graphics (2023) which I touch upon later when <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> for the Cozy-Cloud server. I highlight this essay here though as they are working with Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of \"cripping\" (2003, 37), as a way to feel out in action the ableist assumptions and inaccessible norms of computer graphics and the relations/politics of technoscience more broadly by bringing embodied knowledges and practices of crips in touch with them.Bringing it back to Kafer's work In Feminist, Queer, Crip, she is cripping technoscience by inquiring into the figure of the cyborg and orienting it around disability on two points of contact/impact. Initially, she questions how media represents disabled dependence on technology as real-life cyborgs, leading to the \"rise of the cyborg\" as the unquestionable and naturalised cure for disabled folks. From here she then moves towards a crip critique of Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, away from the naturalised cyborg~crip relations and towards practising relations that challenge the militarised imaginaries of cyborgs and disabled bodies through a disorienting and disobedient crip approach. This refusal, not of these technologies, but of how their imaginaries are oriented, politicised and enacted, is key to my disobedient crip research into technology.Kafer's media analysis of cyborgs shows that they are again sedimented without question to be a cure for impairment, to make 'normal' disabled bodies. These narratives, as raised by Kafer's analyses of Chris Hables Gray's Cyborg Citizen, lead to Gray, an able-bodied science studies scholar, taking up the late Superman actor Christopher Reeve, without his knowledge or consent, as a heroic cyborg leading the way for the disabled community. Gray suggests that the \"crippling of superman\" and Reeve becoming dependent on multiple machines and devices is one of the best examples of a \"true\" cyborg. Gray states that Reeve is a hero as he leads the way for other disabled bodies to be cured through assistive technologies. Gray's text in a number of ways undermines the disabled experience, as it doesn't make room for Reeve or people with disabilities, and more specifically quadriplegic people, to speak to their use of and relation to access and assisted living technologies. Kafer also points out that Gray overlooks and cannot imagine that there is a wider disabled community than just the celebrity in focus, Reeve, or that these communities have a long history and culture of living with assistive technologies that might be informative. Kafer also shares how his use of language often refers to people with disabilities as \"invalids\" or \"patients\", conflating their whole identity and personhood with an injury or the medical identification of their condition. Sitting here, Kafer figures Gray as a prime example of how the disabled bodies are oriented when deployed in cyborg theory. In one of many other examples, Annie Potts' \"taxonomy of cyborgs\" places Reeves in a list with fictional cyborgs, orienting him as less human and more cyborg, a construction rather than a complex, multifaceted person. In these cyborg curing narratives, Kafer shows how this signalling of disabled people as the truest cyborgs locks in and has sedimented the path so much that a cyborg itself becomes a signal for disability, abnormality and difference. The cyborg~crip, the crip~cyborg.By contrast, Kafer reads Haraway's figure of a \"cyborg\" in the Cyborg Manifesto (2006) as problematic in some aspects, but an empowering plurality to think through when approaching with feminist STS. The problematic notions of the Harraway's cyborg are somewhat well known; for example, its homogenising of experiences ny taking an imperializing approach that dictates one figure of an identity for whole groups of people (Kafer 2013, 114). Kafer, however, offers a closer crip critique of Haraway's cyborg, tracing how she has also fallen into the sedimented route that portrays disabled bodies, or as she determines them \"paraplegics and other severely handicapped people\", to be exemplary or true cyborgs. In this move, Haraway makes a number of questionable choices. She addresses these imagined people with disabilities in terms of \"handicap\" and describes them as \"paraplegic\", which reinforces the individualism and diagnosis of the medical model. Kafer also points out this critique of naming languages was fairly common discourse within that era of disability studies, of which Haraway was likely aware. Haraway also homogenizes experiences of disabled people like she does for other identities, but in doing so displaces the affective relations to technologies these different disabled positions and experiences make room for. She essentially does not include any affective perspectives on what it feels like to be a person who is disabled and (inter)dependent with/on technologies and infrastructures.<br>Even though Haraway's \"cyborg\" is in many ways flawed, especially in relation to intersectional disability, Kafer still finds it to be generative from a crip position. In particular, the cyborg can also figure the defiant feminist care in and against flawed and often violent technoscience. The cyborg finds joy in acts of practising radical care otherwise. Kafer disorient the cyborg as a fluid figure that can make room for us to figure out other paths between people with disabilities and the technologies that support them. She refigures the cyborg as a place of embodied crip futures, on their/our terms, validating and tracing a plurality of paths we take with technology together. It is this focus on how the cyborg makes room for crip studies to cross paths with other disciplines and experiences that is what makes this a generative space for her. Kafer gives examples of different cyborg intersections within disability studies, such as Dean Spade's research into the medicalisation of transgender identities. Spade navigates trans experiences of gender identity disorder (GID), which is used to validate care and medication, but also acts to reinforce the binary of gender as well as prolong and delay care (Kafer 2013, 124). GID also leads to tensions, with potentially ableist undertones and a medicalisation of queer identities, where needing to self-identify and be validated as having a \"condition\" or disorder to be treated as trans could lead to gender identity being read as an individual handicap instead of political and relational issue. Spade also reads this medicalisation of GID as reproducing the \"curing\" narrative, where specific treatments can resolve the individual \"problem\" of gender identity, and can be industrialised. Kafer works with Spade and others here to trouble these notions by stating \"that neither medical technologies nor diagnoses can be characterized as purely oppressive or politically neutral\" (Ibid, 125). This disorientation feels the individual within the relational, situated, and makes room for the cyborg and their bodily horizons to be read as \"maps of power and identity\". In doing this, the cyborg also makes space for \"affinity-through-difference\"<a data-footref=\"r21\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-3d3222fe985952f0_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where disabled people as a very diverse community can come together and lay with the disorientation of these many contradictory bodily maps and horizons. With this Kafer figures crips to be cyborgs not because of their bodily relations and dependence on assistive technology and technical infrastructure, that have been naturalised to signal disability, but because of the political practices we disobediently undertake. These acts of refusal are the tracings of our own queer and crip lines, the feeling and coalescing of other crip techno bodies, tables and relations. Some examples of this kind of rubbing up against and disobeying technology, whilst living through it, is shared in Laura Forlano's many works critiquing the cyborg as a concept. In both her Hacking the Feminist Disabled Body (2016) and Living Intimately with Machines (2023) she foregrounds the disabled experience of technology and relation to it as a place of generative friction. If oriented this way it can make room for other perspectives, methods and ethics to be present and felt at these tables. Kafer concludes her analysis by vulnerably opening up the idea that the cyborg within this plurality is also not the only figure for disability, as some disabled experiences may relate more and some less to these technological entanglements. However, she does encourage attending to these sites where disability is pressent within discourse but not felt or made room for. Much like Kafer's intervention into Haraway's cyborg, I also take this approach later in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> with Lucy Suchmans Configuration (2012) to critique the ways disabled bodies can disorient the horizons and practices I take toward collective organisation and network infrastructures. <br>Kafer follows up on Feminist, Queer and Crip (2013) with a talk called Health Rebels: A Crip Manifesto for Social Justice (2017) as well as Manifesting Manifestos (2023). In the Health Rebels talk she covers many of the bases of her work that I have covered elsewhere, but through other informative anecdotes, experiences and relations through which to imagine this work. The focus in this talk is coalition, of cross-issue collaboration and working within difference together. In the talk Kafer appears to refigure her crip cyborg into a number of other figures, such as \"health rebels\", \"the checklist\", and \"the manifesto\". Health rebels play out somewhat similarly to the cyborg, as the defiant crips in the face of the medical industrial complex and institutional ableism. In coalition, living crip as method, multiple and indeterminate, forming frictions at our many horizons and intersection with these generalised and prescribed norms. Disobediently disoriented, aligning to the crip axes. The checklist represents the rubric, matrix or limited drop-down selection that indeterminate disabled bodies are (in)validated through. I discuss my experiences of this further in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> section, where efficient logics determine static lines that are used to invalidate needs, experiences, practises and knowledges. Building on her earlier troubling of the crip cyborg as the only figure to live by, Kafer loosens and refigures the manifesto to be a place of wiggle room, of playing out our dreams, testing out futures, of finding gaps and frictions in these manifestings as generative places to write other crip manifestos and imagine other futures from action. To do this she turns to queer theory, as we could easily to Ahmed, to reflect on how a manifesto (or an orientation) moves along a horizon, foreclosing and limiting some relations whilst putting some others in reach. For Kafer, quoting Audre Lorde, the manifesto is \"believing, working for what has not yet been while living fully in the present now.\"<a data-footref=\"r22\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-3d3222fe985952f0_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> Here it acts as a place to live with uncertainty and practise actioning and inquiring into crip methods for indeterminate futures. Kafer later follows this talk up with her essay Manifesting Manifestos (2023) where she takes an even closer reading of this writing format. In this essay she traces their problematic past within patriarchal modernist thought that unifies bodies, but also the sedimented critique of feminist manifestos that call the mad and crazed. In this Kafer disobediently steps into this critque to question how the manifesto makes room for this crips to be mad with and through their madness. With Breanne Fahs, Kafer also proposes this crazed manifesto as a format that \"invites disorientation\" (2020, 5) as it makes room for a distortion of time and a projection of bodies into other futures not yet in reach, but desired now. She also offers with Kafer (2016) how manifestos are a place to iterate from, adapt, change and find holes in our plans and manifestings. Here again not invalidating, hidding or trying to cure these flaws but, as she reflects on with her students manifesto, it is about making change through embracing and being oriented through these many situated flaws on the plurality of bodily horizons I come into contact with. In this research I ask alongside Kafer how, through a plurality of manifestos, can crip studies and disability justice can take on struggles we may have never imagined before? And how can we try to make room for people and relations that have not yet been imagined or thought of at these sedimented institutional tables yet?In this research, I iterate on from (but still with) Kafer's plurality of crazed manifestos to work more closely with Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch's Crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019). This is to orient my research more closely towards critiques of technoscience, but also to highlight crip manifesting and manifestos in practice. Their manifesto reiterates Kafer's work in a similar way to what I have discussed here, but situates it through more specifically STS relevant examples and positions. Key examples that are relevant to this work include ADAPT activist forming and shaping physical infrastructures by pouring ramps and smashing curbs, as well as Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project forming social and media representation by and for disabled people. Both examples, and many other crip sociotechnical hackings they touch on, manifest forms of direct action, of making change and caring for community infrastructures where institutions invalidate the political/relational forms through which they perpetuate ableism. Hamraie and Fritsch orient the Crip Technoscience Manifesto itself through commitments, manifesting a crip technoscience specifically through direct actions, embodied protocols and political demands. They do this to not only make this manifesto clear and accessible, but also to project into the future the embodied actions and relations that could make room for crip discourses and politics in practices to flourish in relation to technoscience.I discuss these commitments below to highlight key orientations this work is building from.\n\"Crip technoscience centres the work of disabled people as knowers and makers.\"\nThis positions the everyday practices and experiences of disabled people as that which orients them to best know their bodyminds and relations to technologies and society. They work with a few examples of crip designers to show how this plays out in action. Alice Loomer, for instance, shows us how wheelchair maintenance and hacking by the person using it, even though not a frictionless experience, forms practices and knowledges of technology that are situated in relation to that body and its horizon. They quote Loomer saying, \"I have equipment that fits me\", offering how disabled knowing/making through embodied expertise of technologies can make room for these bodies within technoscience. This is not to glorify the Do-It-Yourself practices of disabled people, as some may not be able (or want) to do \"it\", but it is to uplift the \"world-dismantling and world-building labors\" that \"misfitting\" in the world as a crip means and to orient from that disorientation.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to access as friction.\"\n<br>Friction for Hamraie and Fritsch represents the refusal to fit in of crip technoscience, of wanting more than the slots you are offered in the determined checklist, and taking actions and making frictions to make that room. They lay with the \"non-compliant user\", from Ray Lifchez and Barbara Winslow's book Design for Independent Living (1979), who use technology as a friction against an inaccessible environment to highlight the change needed<a data-footref=\"r23\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-3d3222fe985952f0_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. They also discuss Collin Kennedy, an activist and cancer patient, who refused capitalist time around care by spraying expanding foam into hospital car park meters. In doing so, Kennedy disabled the capacity of these infrastructures to monitor and charge patients visiting the hospital, and so forming new possibilities and imaginaries of crip time through direct action forming friction on the sedimented norms. When thinking of frictions, I also want to return to the section on <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_entries/02.02.03_crip_intersectionality.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> with Ashley-X, and think again about the possibility of curtailed joys and pleasures that can come from the frictions of our disabled lives. With crip technoscience this also aims to ask how direct actions, material transformations, practice of maintenance, the rubbing up against restrictions, and the frictions felt from these actions can make room for joy, pleasure and abundance. How could Kennedy wiggling the nose of the expanding foam can into the ticket machine to make room for crip time in a car park, bring joy to not only him, but also to others who were visiting that day. Those who now did not need to rush, or keep in-line and on time? These friction-enabling experiences of crips slips beyond institutional and capitalist time and offers glimpses of a future we can wiggle into with and for one another. With \"access as friction\" we can embrace the struggles of making change where we need it, of getting in the way, and disorienting conversations and in doing so reconfiguring the infrastructures and institutions around us, possibly even with unknowable joy and pleasure.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to interdependence as political technology.\"\nIn the scoping of both feminist technoscience and the political/relational model of disability, how we work together around/for/with technology is itself a type of technology and method that we must orient around and practice. In crip technoscience and wider crip studies, there is a dedication to practising this through interdependence, focusing on how our capacities build up to together, and how we can make room for each other. What politics come from these places, what emerges from the ground up and can radically change the ways we imagine, embody and practice potential future politics now? One example Hamraie and Fritsch quote which resonates with this work is that of Mia Mingus's \"access intimacy\" (2017), which is hard to describe but easily felt. Access intimacy attends to how much someone 'gets' another's access needs, how they make room for them to express these feelings, even if it's stating you don't know what they are right now. Access intimacy as a concept makes room for me to imagine intimate ways of relating to others and how we can care for one another's access needs. It is to be open to the unknown and practice getting to know other's access needs.\n\"Crip technoscience is committed to disability justice.\"\nManifesting crip technoscience that engages in disability rights goes beyond the assimilationist ideologies of mainstream accessibility to highlight how interconnected struggles, and finding justice in them, can make room for even more radical practices for crips within sociotechnical systems. When working for disability justice, crips refuse painful assistive technologies which only normalise their bodies to make others more comfortable. Disability justice also aligns this work with many intersections of disability studies to form a crip technoscience that is informed by and practices with working class, black, brown and indigenous disabled knowledges. It is one where we vouch for crip wholeness and life affirmation as places we can radically challenge the economics and politics of ableist powers that see us as broken or invalid. For this holding the impossible they turn to Eli Clare (2017), whose work suggests we can be broken and yet whole, imperfect, but valued, and holding a generative tension between the (not) opposites of these things.Hamraie and Fritsch also engage with the work of Sins Invalid and other crip artists and hackers to think through what Alice Sheppard (2019) calls \"cultural-aesthetic technoscience\". This is where they bring together new assemblages and aesthetics for communicating these complex relations of wholeness. Sins Invalid, for example, combine performance, technological aids and films doused in unashamed crip joy and pride, not hiding, but embracing and putting on show the potentials for love, grief and playfulness in a very serious but joyous space. As these thinkers and artists share, joy and pleasure are not the only way to achieve or approach disability justice as they can undermine the complex relations of disability globally, which work through oppression and debilitation as politics. Instead, engaging in and making room for this contradictory wholeness of disability justice is what shapes a crip technoscience that coalesces and dances with these sedimented tables through resistance. It is where I can build from the non-innocent, from the disabling continuation/aftermath of war, Big Tech extraction, petrochemical and medical industrial complex, to work with these embodied and plural crip experiences, knowledges and practices to form other ways of caring for each other, our technologies and our communities.<br>Crip manifestos are multiple in the ways that we can understand them coming together through action.

Ahmed is in many ways an amazing commentator on disability and anti-ableism, but here I turn to Alison Kafer's table, and to her work with her Feminist, Queer, Crip. Kafer's formation of the Political/Relational model of disability, and discussion on Crip Time as a concept makes room for me to question through more focused crip lens how \"bodies take shape through tending toward objects that are reachable\" (Ahmed, 2006). In doing so I am thinking through how politics and relations form and hold disability in place, and in turn how through community, interdependence and collective access in action can make room for disability's indeterminacy to manifest many other futures together. I also inquire into Kafer's figuring of crip time not only as a way to hold many indeterminate bodies, but also as a way to understand and navigate the scoping of actions taken in this research. I reflect on the many scales that collaborative labours take, especially around manifesting collective infrastructures, from the infinite small meetings and feelings that I could never capture, to scales of maintenance that could have ended yesterday, or could stretch beyond my lifetime. With this, I also slip onto Kafer's table the Crip Technoscience Manifesto (2019) by Aimi Hamraie and Kelly Fritsch, to re-orient these dialogues towards social and technical infrastructures and science technology studies (STS). Here I orient the crip as a social and technical hacker, reforming and manifesting infrastructures through direct action, affective feedback and refusal that centre crip knowledge and experience within making and doing. With this I ask what does it take for crips to make and sit cozily at tables of disability justice, access and life affirmation within and around institutions and infrastructures of research, computation and care? I want to approach these questions with others, within our capacity, with passion, pleasure and joy, asking: where/how can we make room to imagine and practise other political relations of liberation and affirmation, now?!02.02.00_The_Crip_Table\n\"Can we tell crip tales, crip time tales, with multiple befores and afters, proliferating befores and afters, all making more crip presents possible?\" (Kafer 2021, 418)\n<br>One of the focuses of Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip and her wider research is her figuring out of crip time. Crip time is manifested by many different people in crip theory, from Ellen Samuel's Six Ways of Looking at Crip Time (2017), to Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011, p.&nbsp;62) which offers generative affective definitions, to Kafer's After Crip, Crip Afters (2021) and David P. Terry's Explanation not Excuse (2016) that poetically describe crip times. Prioritizing Crip Futures (Abrams et al., 2024) and Sins Invalid's Crip Kinship of Sins Invalid (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;75) also offer crip time in action in institutional and crip collective contexts. Crip time here makes room for a paradoxical and non-linear temporality that aims to sit with disabled people's bodies and experiences on their terms instead of enforcing a normative able-bodied orientation of time<a data-footref=\"x12\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-94a2e4e4b896ff38_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. In essence, crip time is the refusal of determinate, straight, evenly-paced timelines. I choose to build from Kafer's definitions because of her emphasis on the systemic and political relations of temporalities that freeze and hold crips and disabled folks in place, as well as the ways we can hack and form wiggle room within these dominant hegemonic times. Kafer builds up her definition through a few moves but starts by cripping Lee Edelman's queer time against the future (Kafer 2013, 28). Here she takes up the figure of the 'Child' as a symbol of the future that in queer theory is often also a symbol of the deterministic straight line of inheritance towards able straight futures<a data-footref=\"x13\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-94a2e4e4b896ff38_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. The figure of the Child is also heavily bound to the histories of eugenics, which conflated disabled, racialised, poor and indigenous bodies into the categories \"feeble-minded\" or \"defective\", and used to justify forced sterilisation or euthanasia for the future of the \"race\" (Ibid, 30). The legacies of these eugenic logics persist in contemporary prenatal selection and abortion of disabled children to \"solve\" the problem before it starts, and which the UK has re-enitiated this year (Maia Davies 2025). This emphasis on the future reinforces the endless deferral of care for disabled folks, that instead of making room and capacity to care for them now, orients funding to cure society and futures of their disabled bodies. One example Kafer takes up is of Noam Ostrander's interviews with young black men in Chicago with violently acquired spinal cord injuries (Ibid, 33). She highlights this case as it not only shows how the violent relations through which these men became disabled are so sedimented that their disabling was treated as inevitable, but also that becoming disabled was a foreclosure on their life, and one that determined them to have no future. Here she is sharing how disability is imagined by ableism to have no future, and that to authoritarian eugenics logics, reinforced through race, class, sexuality, gender identity and more, determine disability as a category to forcibly place bodies that they do not want to see in the future.In her book Kafer engages with the figure of the \"Child\" to disorient dialogues around disabled bodies that do not seem to fit in hegemonic futures. She does this by inquiring into both disabled peoples abilities to procreate more disabled bodies (children), as well as exploring the capacities disabled people have to procreate culture, social relations and intimacies. By doing so, she questions the hegemonic terms through which disability's futures are represented. She elaborates on this by studying both mainstream media narratives playing out these political imaginaries and contemporary social and technical infrastructures that reinforce these ableist politics systemically.For example, Kafer reads Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time, and its legacy within feminist studies as a text that demonstrates \"inclusivity\" and political democracy within science (Ibid, 72). Through a crip lens, Kafer's analysis shows it is anything but inclusive or democratic. This Utopian world has in fact eradicated all disabled people without any mention or dialogue that included them. The fictive society is in many ways Utopian because it has eradicated disabled people through genetic science and technological advancement. The fictive infrastructure that has enabled this is called the brooder, which mixes and selects genes to form neutral healthy children of all races, but in doing so eradicates disabled bodies without question. In the same move it also blends and displaces race as a way to cure us of cultural difference and racial inequality. When held in comparison to the depicted Dystopia, which is filled with disabled and mad bodyminds, it shares how disabled people's existence here represents one of the main signifies of this utopian/dystopian split. Beyond the macro of this split, the only mention of disability in the utopia is of people taking mental health breaks, where they drop out from society. This in many ways still enacts the erasure of disability from society, put to one side, siloed and hidden from sight until normal or cured. Through Kafer's analysis she shows how neither the utopian nor dystopian futures make room for or imagine disabled people to live full lives, or affirm their experiences. In these futures disabled people are either the abundant problem or are silently cured from existence as part of the solution. In these narratives, disabled bodies, feelings and experiences are not included in the making of futures. In utopia, they have been invalidated and backgrounded at every step towards this \"greater good\".<br>In response I have shared how Kafer constructs a crip time that makes room to hold the affective, embodied and experiential relations to time that disabled bodies have the capacity to feel. This affective crip relation to time emerges through disabling relations to institutions, systems and infrastructures, or just how disabled bodyminds queerly move through and experience time and space<a data-footref=\"x14\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-94a2e4e4b896ff38_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. Kafer presents many forms of crip time, from the slowing down and indefinite postponing of care, to the immediacy of when we need to care right now. Crip time takes the form of cycles of time that complicate the normative straight cycles of the able-bodied clock, and disables people from accessing in-flexible institutions, financial stability and self-determinacy.Kafer aligns crip time with Jack Halberstam's discussion of queer time, in particular the \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\" of queer life (Ibid, 35). For Halberstam,the immediacy of the AIDS crisis, specifically for gay men and their communities took them out of mainstream and normative time, to a time of \"the here, the present, the now\" (Ibid, 35). In crip contexts, Kafer describes a \"falling time\". Falling ill or getting a prognosis changes perceptions of time, shrinks futures and intensifies the present. When falling into depression, time is slowed to a stop, yet can fly by. How does time feel when there are uncertainties as to whether a chemical, food or unpredictable trigger could induce symptoms that will take you out of time? These fallings into \"strange temporalities\" leaves space for disabled people to feel these times as they are and not line-up to a straight and normative time, validating and enabling crip bodies to tell stories that can change how we think with time.For \"imaginative life schedules\" Kafer brings to the forefront the ways that disabled people have to pre-plan and hack systems of care to be in reach of their needs. How partners and friends need to split carers and medicines, as systems have valued one over the other. How families and friends need to fill the gaps. How bathroom visits have to be pre-planned and scheduled. Kafer poses these \"imaginative life schedules\" not just as the extenuated day to day planning that most disabled people take on, but as the need to project crip bodies into the future to maintain them. This maintenance is highlighted not just as (re)production that we see within efficiency models, but as pleasurable acts of each day, and towards unknown practices of radical access. These schedules then become a place with a possibility of joy for organising and maintaining embodied futures for disabled lives that resist the violence of institutional and hegemonic determination of disabled futures.With \"eccentric economic practices\" Kafer talks about the ways that crip people are economic hackers. When the lines of systemic and institutional care don't hold you and you start to slip through. When they limit how much you can earn to maintain your care subsidies and determine you into a certain level of (dis)comfort. This is when these eccentric economics are necessitated and practised, to trade goods, favours and pleasures under the radar so that crips don't compromise our basic needs and care. These economics for Kafer this offers a blurring of the public/private in a way that makes room for these economics to be a test bed for us to imagine what crip politics in action might be capable of. This is where our everyday practices of collective access and interdependence become radical methods for rethinking the politics of how we come together and table, or put to bed our differences.<br>Kafer's situates crip time between a time of falling in the here and now, meanwhile maintaining our bodies to enact a future with us in it by practising politics of our everyday. Kafer goes on to examine how this framing of crip time lines up against narratives of longevity, focusing on cripping Halberstam's notion of keeping going \"under any circumstances\"<a data-footref=\"x15\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-4-94a2e4e4b896ff38_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>. In a queer refusal of longevity, hegemony is understood to reproduce deterministic futures indefinitely. A crip position instead sits with each situated body differently. Kafer asks what it means for that or this body to keep going \"under any circumstance\"<a data-footref=\"x16\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-5-94a2e4e4b896ff38_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a>, and how can we ease the institutional and social pressures that curtail crip life at every turn. Here she is moving to also step out of line and inquire, \"what are the circumstances we need but also desire?\", and by asking this, also asking how to orient them to be within reach.To make time for crip time, where we feel our crip bodies maintained in a future that holds them is to radically reconfigure our relations to almost every part of our lives under efficient time. To embody a future with us in it is to practice access as affirmation and to make room and time for people to consent, to be present in and the capacity to care for that time. A future embodied by crips would aim to foster time from a another radical set of roots that can overlay, intertwine and embrace a plurality of times. This radical embrace of crip time makes room within relations, futures and immediate actions that make time for us to hold this crip stuff with care \"under any circumstances\".<br>To tie down and bring in-line the proliferating befores and afters of these indeterminate crip time tales, as I have had to for this thesis, I have thought about how to find orientation within space and time that shifts, trickles and lets loose without reason. To sit in disorientation is to be crip, and to be crip is to be more than aslant from the straight axis of time.

With this approach, the research makes room for my collaborators and I to be in touch with these network infrastructures. Doing this we focused on where we felt slips, slants, gaps and frictions to orient our approaches to the normative logics within computing. This was to question how these points of impact give us an ambivalent relation for us to imagine and practise crip futures from now. In coalescing Ahmed, Kafer, Hamraie and Fritsch, as well as many others, together in a crooked crip line for this chapter, I have formed a framework that aims to overflow from these sites of friction. This is to not avoid or invalidate these disconnects and misfittings, but to think through how they can inform other orientations from a position of radical Crip intersectionality, interdependence and disability justice. Working from these crip slants, naps and f(r)ictions are places that can build up our collective capacities for us to move off from the sedimented straight line of inheritance, break open the normative pipeline, and its determined relations, and make room for this research to question how my collaborators and I want to approach relational \"problems\" we are seated at together ourselves.<br>To disorient these tables and relational norms I later turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a> as an axis of radical access, interdependence and coalition where I informed my practise and research.

This methodology and its iterating plurality of manifestings will unfold more throughout the thesis, but moves to put more digital network practice within reach of crip theory discourse. This is to think about how we can foster and centre crip practices and politics of radical care within our local community and collective configuration practices, but also to think about how these politics can overflow and make room and flexibility in these hard systems for other lines to be emegred elsewhere by others also facing their own frictions with efficient, white supremacist and curative politics. This approach aims to form collective politics that do not determine or prescribe methods and approaches, but makes room to contemplate how I as a collective technical practitioner can become intimate with collaborators access needs. Here making wiggle room for us all to be experts, practitioners and knowers/makers of our own (life affirming) infrastructures, and in doing so gaining agency and capacities at the tables we have always been present at, but were never allowed to get to grips with.02.03.00_ConclusionThe Crip relation to intersectionality is one of the most radical approaches to the term, as it is so abundant and overflowing. This is due to the variety of bodies, experiences and struggles that exist under the broad terms of disability. Of course we can turn to Kimberly Crenshaw's definition of intersectionality(Crenshaw 1991; 2015), and it's emergence from groups like the Combahee River Collective, where \"interlocking oppressions\" form at the cross roads of identities. This in many ways comes from and speaks to disability (even if it is not overtly stated), but I find it more interesting to look at definitions that come from the overt practices of crip studies. This Crip kinship (2021) as Shayda Kafai would term it, is where the abundance of crip communities and interdependence of intersections shine. Kafai's book centres on the practices of Sins Invalid, a crip performance group started by Patty Berne and Leroy Moore. Sins Invalid's work centres expressing crip pleasures, joy and desire without shame and through interdependence. The group's definition of intersectionality is one that I hold dear in my research and repeatedly reflect on in my practice.\n\"Sins Invalid defines intersectionality this way: \"Simply put, this principle says that we are many things, and they all impact us. We are not only disabled, we are also each coming from a specific experience of race, class, sexuality, age, religious background, geographic location, immigration status, and more. Depending on context, we all have areas where we experience privilege, as well as areas of oppression... We gratefully embrace the nuance that this principle brings to our lived experiences, and the ways it shapes the perspectives we offer.\"\" (Ibid, 31)\nThis definition of intersectionality by Sins Invalid has helped me to think through how I can come together with collaborators to practice crip freedoms together. To treat these intersections with care and situate our capacities, privileges and desires into and out of alignment. Kafer also notes Robert McRuer's notion of \"the non-disabled claim to be crip\" (2013, p.&nbsp;169), which I follow: the possibility of able bodied crips, of those working for the disabled cause, but also maybe those that recognise the \"the disability to come.\" Committing to this wider scope of intersectional disability justice is a key step for any crip studies critique, as accessibly explained in Ella Parry-Davies' Coming out Crip (2022) audio piece. She, much like myself, is only \"stable\" because we live in the UK with a state health system that recognises our needs, and can \"treat\" them in its medical scoping of our conditions. If we were to live elsewhere, have different nationalities and the relational support those bodies have, we might not even be here, or able to make these statements. With this we embed ourselves within the mutual cause against all intersecting injustices towards disability.In this dialogue privilege and oppression are situated and negotiated both with intimacy. With this I have asked how can I as a white crip researcher, within academic institutions that are often inaccessible to other intersections of disabled people, use my privilege and oppression in this experience and context to leverage resources and change discourses to position disability justice and radical access as the next action I take at every turn? It also asks me to know that I will never know the experiences of other people with disability and to have patience and commitment, to get in touch with and to learn to communicate our collective sense making. It is to take our sweet crip ass time to get a feel for one another, and affirm each other along that path and journey.I find it important to think through intersectionality with Kafer's reading of Ashley-X's story. This is because it offers clearly the ways we have to defy the urge to divide disability through its diversity, but to instead centre and care for these bodies on the margins of our discourse. Ashley is born with \"static encephalopathy\", that leads her doctors to state that \"her development never progressed beyond that of an infant\", and means that she depends on constant care for her lifetime. The nickname by carers for the condition and similar disabilities is a \"pillow angel\". Another element of this relation is that her body developed at a \"normal\" pace, and at age 6 her parents started to be concerned about what puberty would do to her. From consultations with medical \"experts\" they set up a plan to remove Ashley's uterus and breast buds, as well as put here on a high dose oestrogen regime. The medical \"experts\" in dialogue with the parents validated this treatment for many reasons, from \"saving\" Ashley from pains of menopause and puberty, as well as keeping her small so her parents could care and protect her directly, as well as keeping her safe from her own mature body. This meant that the way Ashley and her body were unconsensually treated was to be shaped for the able bodied world around them. They just made her easy to handle as well as protected from relations held in place by ableist and violent sexist politics. I work with Kafer's reading of Ashley for a few reasons, partially as it highlights the ways disabled bodies and experiences are curtailed to fit the hard ableist systems, scales and needs, instead of considering the disabled bodymind's own needs, orientations and desires. It also shares the length that these sorts of ableist actions can be taken to, how far an individual who cannot oppose can be shaped to fit the efficient line, instead of questioning the political relations of the line itself. This is highlighted by some mixed views from both medicine and disability studies, whether a person like Ashley-X is too disabled to be disabled, and whether people like them need their own category (Kafer 2013, 67). This division provokes yet another boundary beyond the able/disabled projected axis, forming again new complex parameters that permit questionably dehumanising and violent treatments, such as the one Ashley-X recieved. Kafer asks here what if we place people like Ashley-X not outside of disability discourse, but in the centre of it? When I start to imagine relations and tables to care for these experiences and not determine and invalidate their communication ability, I open myself up to feel and be felt through many yet unknowable ways. Kafer's enactment of crip theory here also centres the joy of this communication. In Ashley-X's case, a double mastectomy and hormone blockers to stop her breasts growing means that Ashley was also disabled from having any pleasure from these removed organs. Their pleasure was never imagined, nor valued in their future, only pain. That just because these experts were did not have the capacity to feel Ashley's expressions of joy, imagine their bodily possibilities of pleasure and agency, or even contemplate their political desires meant that it was these experts who had invalidated Ashley without question or dialogue. Instead of joy or pleasure, the dialogues around Ashley's body focus on pain or discomfort and keeping her secure from strangers, who may also feel this discomfort around her. Reflecting on Ashley-X through crip intersectionality, it can also be understood that this probably only happened to her as she came from a middle class American family that could afford to treat her through these medical industrial institutions. When I highlight her context, I think to how I can build up capacities to be in dialogue with each other. This is also amplified by disability as such a diverse field that includes so many bodyminds in so many different situated social/political relations. Again a crip move is to centre joy and pleasure as an actionable site for us to move from, but this is not to say we silence or ignore the very real pain that exists everyday within our community internationally and intersectionally. It instead aims to move beyond deterministic narratives of disability as painful and awkward and asking what brings us together through joy, comfort and pleasure, even if we are dealing with pain, depression and disabling social relations. Through feeling out these restraints we can start to move towards interdependently asking/demanding how to put our desires in reach of one another?In Kafer's final chapter, 'Accessible Futures, Future Coalitions', she gives an example of Silvia Yee's work with the Disability rights education and Defense Fund (DreDF) (2013, p.&nbsp;160). Kafer highlights their work with communities facing the overburden of toxic industries and emissions to show how policy and access put in place to help disabled people in many ways benefits everyone. In the case of DreDF the rights of children with respiratory issues can stop schools and institutions from using potentially harmful chemical pesticides, which can benefit not only the quality of life of everyone in that district but also reduces the ecological impacts. This presents Crip intersectionality as a powerful place where in coalition we can leverage our communities access privileges to not only improve their individual lives but to put a future we all want into reach.This is where the interdependence of crips also sits as an essential practice. When disabled people struggle to perform as required by a system or to be valued the same as able-bodied people, communities have to help each other manage the gaps. Like I shared in Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures with Kafer's take on Halberstam's \"strange temporalities, imaginative life schedules, and eccentric economic practices\", all of these crip times are threaded through community schedules, care and interdependence. These acts can range from just consolidating to each other that it is fine that we are sad and mad, that there are gaps in what we are able to do, and being there when we almost fall through them.<br>In the third episode of the Crip Club podcast<a data-footref=\"x18\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-1-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> , which discusses disabled representation in films and media, Clare Baines interviews Jessi Gutch around cancer portrayals (Baines, o.&nbsp;J.). In the podcast they not only talk around what it means for Gutch to not fit into the curative narrative of cancer, but she also shares her experiences of living with a disability whilst working in the film industry. The section I felt was most informative for understandings of intersectionality and interdependence of disabled folk, is when she is talking about working in a majority disabled set. This crip background informed a very different set of expectations and capacities for one another. Gutch says that this formed a space where people could express their needs easily and have them affirmed, where everyone on set knew that this film was important, but not the most important thing. The most important thing is that everyone in this collaboration was feeling as good as they could in their bodyminds and able to do what they wanted to within the collaboration. It was where if they needed more time for this crip stuff they could have it without question.<br>In my practice as I have started to collaborate with more disabled and crip people I have also felt this same energy, where our wellbeing, capacities and feelings are prioritised over an imagined deterministic outcome or performance of work. I talk more about this in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a> section, but to touch on one of these collaborations that is of note here was in the creation of the crip infrastructure en-crip-ing time<a data-footref=\"x19\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-2-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, a work that imagines and instigates crip times within computational time. I go on to discuss this work in context and in more detail in a later inquiry discussed in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time</a>. Here though one major part of the work was to focus on this type of crip relating between my collaborator Mariana Marangoni and I in the making of the infrastructure. This meant that there were no agile time-lines, roles or outcomes here, just crip times, flexibility and compassion. We both had many demands from life, and very crip times in relation to our bodyminds, but we both understood that for this intersection and crip infrastructure to emerge we both needed these times to prioritise our needs. When one of us had to freeze time to recover or get through something it was okay, we just said, and adjusted the timeline or responsibilities. When one got stressed and anxious about the imposed time-lines, the other didn't combat this, but comforted it. The expectations would be flexible to fit our current capacities, and frictions became places to orient from and to learn each other's needs and approaches. These social politics, ways of relating and maintaining crip infrastructure became important to show in the work. To make it present in the background of the work we added comment sections in the html of the poem, showing our conversations of making time and space for this crip stuff.<br>Here I return again and again to imagine where we can find joy in rubbing up against each other's supports and restraints in relation, and how this practice is a language we all have to practise and build capacity for independently. It is a language of sensing what each other's capacities, privileges, knowledges, desires and feelings are, and learning to understand them as they unfold. In a crip intersectionality I turn to this movement of coalition and interdependence in action, of bringing together divergent bodies and movements to manifest the change we as a group need now. Crip coalitions in themselves are temporary comings together of differing politics, structures, goals and needs to configure the social and technical infrastructure for change and affirmation we need now. In Ren Britton's Coalition Bouquet<a data-footref=\"x20\" href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fn-3-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, they trace many of these histories and the improvised technologies, politics and communities that came together to blossom crip change together. Here these often complex, divergent and temporary coalitions can move beyond the predetermining confines of pain, which they may be in, to where they can reorient the issues of intersectional access to make room to hold the possibility of joyous direct action and change.In this research, this has been taken up as working between different departments, institutions, collective, projects, coalitions, mailing lists, servers and etherpads. Most importantly though, for me as a person with fatigue, chronic pain and other complicating factors, this has meant pushing for accessible ways of managing and maintaining collective practices, and trying to introduce a disorienting crip axis to (dis)align with. This inquiry has been about intersectionally and interdependently reorienting practices, figures, timelines, expectations, infrastructures and priorities. In particular, inquiring into how I can question my own role in these dynamics to support crip politics, both in our organisation and by making them accessible to collaborators. I am also taking this up in response to broader questions of interdependence within the networks, infrastructures, and politics these collaborations manifest and are held in place by. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://thecripclub.co.uk/podcast/\" target=\"_self\">https://thecripclub.co.uk/podcast/</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-1-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://time.cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://time.cozy-cloud.net/</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-2-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://lorenbritton.com/projects/coalition-bouquet\" target=\"_self\">https://lorenbritton.com/projects/coalition-bouquet</a><a href=\"02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/02_disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table_canvas.html#fnref-3-7dae4bbc2562507c_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n02.02.03_Crip_intersectionality03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvasAlison Kafer's Feminist, Queer, Crip is a foundational work for understanding how disability can be analysed from a crip perspective and approach. It looks to complicate the way that disability is represented and mediated, moving on from both the medical model and social model of disability, to one that can hold the diversity of intersections queer and disabled bodies experience as well as making room to critique the wider implications of a cure narrative. In the medical model of disability, as Kafer notes, quoting Simi Linton, \"the proper approach to disability is to \"'treat' the condition and the person with the condition rather than 'treating' the social processes and policies that constrict disabled people's lives.\"\" (2013, 5). The medical model treats the sickness or \"abnormality\" of disabled people on an individual basis and in doing so ignores and invalidates the background to their potentially disabling social relation. In doing this the medical model also ignores the experiences of disabled people whose bodies are not only most affected by these orientations, but also have the affective and situated knowledges that are essential to their nuanced affirming care. The medical model sees that \"solving the problem of disability, then, means correcting, normalising, or eliminating the pathological individual\" (Ibid, 5). A cure here can mean returning to being \"able bodied\" but it can also be interpreted as society being cured of disabled bodies. This medical model draws a line that forces disabled people to one side, and off of the table systematically through isolating them from it financially (Ibid, 39), as well as through eugenic regimes of genetic selection (Ibid, 76) and curing ideologies of technological enhancement (Ibid, 107).A later and more accepted model within the disabled community is the social model, which aims to draw attention to the social aspects and the background of disability that the medical model invalidates. It does this through an 'impairment/disability' axis, which makes room to understand what a person is capable of and how a society/system can limit their abilities relationally. To do this the social model defines impairment as \"any physical or mental limitation\" (Ibid, 7) and argues that \"disability signals the social exclusions based on, and social meanings attributed to, that impairment\" (Ibid, 7). Kafer sums it up simply: \"impairments aren't disabling, social and architectural barriers are\" (Ibid, 7). This is in many ways generative for re-approaching disability's \"problems\", moving them from the individual to societal, infrastructural and political scales.With Susan Wendell, Kafer queries the social model by asking, \"how far one must be able to walk to be considered able-bodied\" (Ibid, 7). While seemingly simple, this question opens many political and relational queries. What are the geographies (are there smooth walkways on flat-ish land?), economics (could they afford the walking aid or pain relief tablets?) community relations (was their friend free and able to help, or community carer available?), politics (are their medications legal?) and infrastructures (were they able to connect to a community, was an input valid on a form?). These questions move the approach away from a standardised test on an individual, and into understanding the nuances of disabling political dynamics on people's abilities, relationally and societally. Wendell and Kafer consider both impairment and disability to be socially constructed, as bodies are only seen as disabled in relation to sedimented \"able\" ones. Returning to Ahmed, we could ask how Crips line up to the determinate straight able-bodied line or axis? And Crips would probably respond, \"huh? what axis?\", or, maybe on another day, feeling more provocative, \"We don't have to!\"Kafer also notes that the social model, when taken to an extreme, inverts the orientation of the medical model, and in doing so can invalidate people with disabilities. An example is of those disabled people who acknowledging their pain or other impairments may have a desire for a cure to them, but this in the social model could be read as playing into the medical models' narrative of a cure they are trying to counter. In this inversion it can also overlook the fact that some disabilities, such as chronic health, pain and fatigue, will not change no matter how much we change social relations. Along this thread the social model also negates to contemplate how a cure narrative towards a particular (abled) kind of body can affect people who might not identify as disabled or be \"impaired\". Kafer gives the examples of anti-ageing creams that can play on the anxieties of getting old as well as growth hormones for shorter children to make them \"normal\" height. Both can be understoon as ableist and reliant on a curative model. From this orientation, we can understand how the social model orients disability to be delineated along fine lines, and in many ways undermines the radical knowledges of disabled experiences and the relations they can put in reach.Kafer proposes the political/relational model to reorient the social model's impairment/disability axis. Kafer's model asks what immediate changes to relations not only validate, but also ease and make room to build up the capacities of people living with experiences of disability, neurodiversity, chronic illness and pain \"under any circumstances\" (Ibid, 41), which I go on to discuss further in the next section on Crip Time &amp; Crip Futures.In action, navigating disability through these models can be quite sad, as we understand how overwhelming these social and institutional politics and pressures are on our crip bodyminds, and how violent, forceful and invalidating they are in action. However, by making room to navigate and analyse these institutional tables and their bodily horizons from a crip orientation, we are able to set out our own paths to move around the sinkholes and vacuums they hold in place to erase our lives, experiences and voices from the discourse about disabled people and our place in the future. In this research this takes the form of questioning how I have collectively organise around and with technology, away from curative narratives of efficiency and control within these institutional politics, and instead towards collective care, maintenance and access towards our own crip social and technical infrastructures.02.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"02.01.02_Queering_the_axis","level":1,"id":"02.01.02_Queering_the_axis_0"},{"heading":"Queering

Here I am channelling Alice Wong and her many interviews from the Disability Visibility Project (2017), grounding this work in the misfitting and disorientations of being disabled. I do this through a Crip-Tic of Vignettes, playing on the tych scales, from diptych to triptych to other compositions, and Cripping it to a tic (Maier et al., 2020) to hold the contradictory scales, relations and recursive experiences these times unfold through. Instead of a static or linear scaling as norm the Crip-Tic makes room for these vignettes to be positioned inside, beside and beyond each other, whilst also holding the possibility of more and less crip times to be held in relation. The Crip-Tic also aims to hold these crip times not in a primarily analytical form, which could undermine or filter their stories towards a particular point, but instead holds them as Crip times in all their complexity, forming wiggle room in my thesis for them to be held in relation and refracted through later findings.This assemblage in this research draws out four tics of crip times to orient around and within. Crip times at the academic table, where access is desired but superficial, with little negotiation of or room made for what working with critical access and crip studies entails. Crip times within the computational table, reflecting on the standardised forms and their gaps to fill, the limited choices and obfuscated agencies within computing and the technical systems that we are conformed to by our everyday relations to institutions. Crip times on the operating table, where care as treatment is executed within institutions, and where the medical model invalidates and cures society of the sick through configurations of violence and neglect. After these sections I turn and retreat to crip times at the crip table, the table of disability justice and life affirmation, and one where I have experienced radical sets of crip care and politics in action.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Crip-Tic of vignettes","level":1,"id":"Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.00_intro.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612766,"modifiedTime":1756048612766,"sourceSize":2199,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.00_Intro.md","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.00_intro.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html":{"title":"03.01_The_research_table","icon":"","description":"In this section I will talk about experiences of being a Crip in an academic institution in the U.K., and practising within the norms of these research institutes. There are many examples of this within Crip texts, for instance, Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011), but my experiences and tics are contextually specific and form an embodied foundation for this work, the conditions it emerges from and aims to address. I trace the very queer lines of bumping into, running away from, and figuring out what feel like more cozy boundaries in relation to academic institutions. If I return to Ahmed's brief reflection on repetitive strain injury (RSI), how do these paths, these desks and inherited orientations of work determine us to be broken before we even start? In exploring these examples, I aim to open up how academic practices and imaginaries of futures do not imagine us there before we even begin, and in response we need to make lots of Crip trouble so that we can wiggle ourselves in.Accessibility in institutional terms can prevent disabled researchers from being present at the table. For example, at a major science and technology studies conference in 2024, accessibility was reframed, in practice, to mean early career researchers but not disabled people or other intersections of marginalised international communities either. This was enacted through the logic of cutting costs on hybrid access to fund early career researchers. In cutting the hybrid accessibility to the event, disabled people who find it hard to access in person could not easily be in dialogue, but also those with limited access due to geopolitics and border regimes could not be present either. This left some panels with a fraction of their speakers, falling short of being accessible to these broader intersections of un-imagined communities. The conference also had an inclusive set of food tokens for the event, but with my dietaries I could not make use of most of them so ended up paying for my own food on top as well. These everyday examples of inaccessibility in academic spaces and institutional norm build up to larger, sometimes exhausting, patterns that make these spaces unlivable for many.From here, I want to attend in more depth to how academic institutions reproduce what Kafer describes as Crip-less futures. Specifically, I am going to discuss a project in which I wanted to imagine with Crip bodies what a future might be. In this experience I realised that academic institutions often can't feel this Crip stuff in their framings of accessibility, as they keep it at the edge of their reach, with no capacity of being intimate. I was told many times what accessibility is by able bodied people in these institutes, prescribed roles I must follow and spaces and times I must fit to, often with my frictions, labours and issues being hidden from view or easily packaged and moved. In this reflection I share where and how I have taken care of my bodymind and this Crip stuff, in order to speak up to and reorient the institution's deterministic ableist configurations of futures.I applied for a residency with a major research facility, let's call them X - Digital Future Institute (or X-DFI). In placing the X here I retain partial anonymity, but also refer to SoLiXG's definition of XG<a data-footref=\"g1\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html#fn-1-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, denoting the infinite growth of digital institutions, infrstructures, and imaginaries. In SoLiXG's case this is the power of big tech network and cloud \"solutions\", and in mine the ever-prevailing ableist institutes of digital futures that will never imagine or be able to hold Crips in their \"infinite\" futures.I originally applied to this residency with the concept of making a crip infrastructure in the form of a server accompanied by a relaxation space. I explained clearly in my application that it was an infrastructure made by and for disabled people that also included a chill space for disabled people to decompress and relax. I expressed clearly my desire that the online space and IRL installation were for crips to have a safe and calm space to collectively imagine what crip futures and practices online might look like. They accepted the project, I was relieved as I could get paid to do some of my own work, and relax about financial stresses. In the first meeting they told me they were chose me because they liked that it was Crip stuff.I was appointed a \"mentor\" who I met up with briefly. We began to chat about the project and work, I discussed for minimum five minutes ideas of creating infrastructures through non-prescriptive methods. He told me he was the method man, he loved methods and it would be great if I could generalise these methods. I didn't feel heard. I carried on talking about network infrastructures, about alternative imaginaries of care around their limits, from a Crip interdependent approach. He said he didn't understand.<br>In the meetings following, the mentor repeatedly questioned the validity of the project and my ability and capacity to make it, instead of caring for its growth. He asked whether a relaxation space was a valid artwork. I tell him there have been many works, by crip artists and others, such as Carmen Papalia's Pain Pals<a data-footref=\"g2\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html#fn-2-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, Navild Acosta and Sosa's Black Power Naps<a data-footref=\"g3\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html#fn-3-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> and M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured<a data-footref=\"g4\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html#fn-4-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> that orient this approach. Each of them talk about different groups needing space to stop from the incessant efficiencies of late capitalism, to sit in and make their own times and to feel safe. It still didn't seem to be valid to him. He again questioned my capacity to make the digital infrastructure, whether I was able to do what I knew I could do (and had done before). Over email, they asked for quantities: , how long the work would be up, how much community I expected? Repeatedly I had to explain what it was, how I was going to make it. Every time, he exclaimed he didn't understand the theory or the practice, and asked for validity again. There was no trust or affirmation of this Crip infrastructure.Initially my \"mentor\" told me verbally that the fee was just for me as payment, and they would cover materials and expenses. I was already putting more work into this infrastructure than the fee entailed, as I cared for this stuff. When it came time to get materials, I sent through expenses, and waited. This was during the period where the validity was being doubted (which was realistically the whole time). I had to send through renders to visualise to them what it might be, and costings of materials which took more care and more time. I waited. I emailed to follow up. I waited. The time of the project stood still, Crip infrastructure frozen in-validity. They replied. The cost of the materials now had to come from my fee, unless they were of value and could be used by the X-DFI in the institution's futures. I told them that this was not okay. A while later they offered a small sum, but I still had to pay the majority for the proposed work. This dialogue froze the project for at least a month, as I could not start until I had the small amount of stuff I needed to care for the work. The fee itself then also got frozen so I had to pay out of my pocket to get going. Due to \"institutional\" delays the payment time had become indefinite, postponed to an unknown date. Due to these delays, I had even less time to care for this stuff.They delayed the submission a bit, but the damage was already done. I did not really trust, through their actions, that this was a place that could hold Crips, or imagined them being here in this X - Digital Future Institute. There was no flexibility in this hard institute for Crips there. The mentorship could not flex to understand, acknowledge or listen to Crip methods, practices and knowledges, and instead turned me into the problem that needed to be cured. Instead of making space for and affirming these imaginaries, however haphazard they might have seemed, they chose to judge it repeatedly, not finding it valid in their terms. Their terms seemed to infantilize what they thought Crips had capacity for, repeatedly asking me to just make something soft for stimming, easily packaged and handled for when they present it to conferences. They didn't want to handle an awkward Crip body or infrastructure. The change of terms to finances also reduced my trust greatly, as it showed they did not understand or legitimise financial accessibility as a barrier, and that their word was not stable. Due to the payment delays, funding changes and my financial precarity I had to take on another job at the same time, developing an app for another research project. This change of terms, and the eddies that flowed in its trail are additive to the stress and relations that caused my last flare up, and why I ended up back on the operating table I mention in the next section.After these initial fallouts, I just kept myself to myself and made the infrastructure on the cheap. Though I in many ways had lost faith in this residency, I carried on mainly for the funding and to make my this crip infrastructure \"against all odds\". So I decided to approah the work as a prototype of what Crip infrastructures might feel like. Using the technical setup I had already knew and developed, but leaving the community out of it whilst the X-DFI voices were still involved. I accompanied this with some cute stickers I rendered and wrote their Alt texts as Crip imaginaries of caring with and for digital network infrastructures. I go on to talk about this infrastructure more in the A Cozier Configure-ability chapter, but in this relation and on top of all the other things I had going on I didn't have the capacity to get them to listen to the nuances of this change or its reasons, so I just didn't communicate it with them.The first payment came through as we were getting ready to display, months late. The accessibility of the space had been miscommunicated, stating there was a lift, then there wasn't one, and then there was, which made me anxious about showing there. It turned out it was fine. In preparation for the show, they began quantifying again, asking questions like, what's the maximum time for a person to relax in the space? They didn't seem to feel time slots undermined crip relaxation or politics. They repeatedly tried to put the work in a small single occupancy tipi, to shade disabled people from the light, and maybe hide us away? It also seemed culturally inappropriate to display my work in, as a white British artist.When it came to the time to show the work, even though we had been promised all along that this would be open to the public, and my application explicitly said the work was for the disabled community, they had not listened and it turned out it was just for a private event for the investors of this new building. It was for an event so private that even we the artists were not invited to it. They used this exhibition as the signing off of the works, and again used it to pressure me into buying my own train tickets and paying for my own expenses to set up the work. By this point, I couldn't be bothered to argue against this.I pitched up to the X-DFI, and was the first one there. I had a nice chat with the receptionist and he offered me a cozy cup of tea. I waited next to a wall of tech company logos. They turned up. We had a tour of the X-DFI, with its brand new facilities in digital twin technology, still half built, with cables and tubes hanging down. It looked expensive, the jewel in the crown of this digital future. I told them it was a dual use technology. They asked what that was. I told them it meant it was made specifically to have both military and commercial uses. They looked surprised. We went upstairs to the open loft space. They had snacks that I couldn't really eat. Luckily, I always bring my own.I started to set up the work, I chose a nice side with good plugs and ports. I got the server connected fine, and the site was up. I pulled out the soft cushy cloud pillows I had made with a collaborator. They looked surprised I had stuff. I placed the easy read, take home text of the cozy intentions on the table. It was installed, it was a very easy setup.Soon after though, they came with stuff. Stuff they wanted to stuff in. I hadn't been told about or consented to this stuff. They brought a weighted blanket, which was nice, but was definitely prescribed, and was for the institution and not for the Cozy-Cloud. Play-dough and colouring in bits, that didn't really fit in and seemed to infantilize disabled people. All of this stuff brought and placed in the space without real dialogue or care. They stepped back, and asked again how accessible the space really is, it seems a little technical for \"disabled\" people and for people from the \"street\". I told them to access the work you just have to try and relax. They didn't. I asked them who the people categorised and figured to be from the street were? I explained I was creating social access to technical practices and processes which in some places of course will be a little technical, but I am trying to make it as accessible as possible. He asked to edit the cozy intentions of the server. I said no. He asked if he was not woke enough. I said I don't think you have the right lived experience to edit a text by and for disabled people. He eventually left me alone.After they had taken their photo op, where I masked a smile, I left my Crip centred space to be shown to the rich investors of this institute, and we went for dinner. We went to a restaurant where they had tried to make it accessible but it still wasn't great for me. I didn't want to cause trouble again so just went anyway. We ate some dinner, I dared to have one dish and we chatted. My \"mentor\" complained about how much free work and excessive stuff he had to do to get anywhere in his career and how much he felt he suffered. I thought he should value and care for his time and capacity more. I chatted to other people around the table. When we were finishing up, he got the whole table's attention and said, \"I really don't think artists suffer enough to make good work anymore\". I stopped. I leaned forward, and I said, \"As someone who lives with chronic pain, I really don't think any value should be placed on suffering\". He suddenly and eventually went quiet. Later after dinner he sent me a text to apologise, I am not sure if he realised what these sedimented politics also meant for him, or if he had felt \"caught out\".I couldn't touch that Crip server for a while after this experience. All of those intentions seemed sullied by this \"mentorship\" and exclusion from the futures of X institutes. The longer term eddies, the subsequent flare up, operations and appointments this experience and its stresses had contributed to meant that trying to make a crip infrastructure for and by crips for relaxation had in fact manifested itself into more crip pain, stress and struggle when in relation to an X Digital future of these institutions. Now, I am moving to care for these scars and tender, frictious relations, to re-orient the spaces I have capacity in so I can work within them cozily. In softer actions I have pulled out one of the Cozy-Cloud cushions and now sleep with it, dreaming of X-C/CFI (Crip/cozy future infrastructures) most nights. This experience is one that has made me care even more for where I table my Crip stuff. Are academic institutions able to, or do theyeven desire to hold this Crip stuff? Or will their values, politics, relations and orientations always hold it out of reach and disable them from caring for the stuff of Crip futures? <br>\"\"XG\" is an industry term for anticipatory technological iteration that we in SoLiXG extend to capture the process of developing, expanding and maintaining digital infrastructures, always with an eye to the next generation.

I am approaching this through two avenues here, though there are many other approaches I could take. The first is to reflect on how I as an individual have systemically by multiple institutions been placed and prescribed to specific cells within tables by others as they translate my experience into evidence to validate my care. Here I am thinking this through with Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). I will also reflect on how I as a teacher and carer for students have found the computational interface of access, and the social relations of students' access needs often hidden or held out of reach, making it harder to care for their access out of the norms of these institutions.The first step is opening the tab on how I have been categorised, documented and (in)validated by both academic and care institutes. Within both there has always been a separation between me and my embodied knowing of my experience, and the computational cells that it is put into. This separation is carried out by the \"expert\" or the \"specialist\" who \"knows\" what I am experiencing better than I do, and who will translate and filter it into the abstract syntax and figures that are valid within these political systems and institutional relations. All of these orientations take what has happened to me, how I feel about it and the sense I make from it, and de-legitimise and invalidate them, to instead be stated in the abstract words and figures they have sedimented out of reach of me. It is also with the understated and normalised violence through which these invalidating logics are instrumentalised. This has manifested for me as 9 years of my specialist and carers denying my chronic pain, as \"studies and figures show that part of my body doesn't have pain receptors\". This is until recently, when another cell has been ticked even further out of my reach, and certain medications for chronic pain have been legalised, and so seemingly has my pain. It is also that another \"expert\" regulating my workplace stress and need for access, and who was mediating the input into its validating ex-cell table, was a manager who was additive to my workplace stress. When I asked (as I had a number of times before) if he could invite me to the relevant staff meetings for me, as I was part time, his reasonable adjustment was instead to tell me to come to every third one. In reflection this left me more anxious as I still wasn't sure which to go to, or if I would get in the way. I also reflected to myself here how meeting invites are a fairly standard practice, and the computed table of the calendar event had space for this invitation, but instead he just refused to action this.Here, I approach the computing table through Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). For her, this concept covers the many ways that people with disabilities in need of direct physical care, can be forced into intimate contact with those around them, who can often be strangers. She also widens this scope to think similarly about how disabled people often have to give up intimate information about ourselves to validate our access needs, and yet often still don't have them met in return. Little care is given to these relations within computing tables. When working through getting my access needs recognised, and reasonable adjustments made for my teaching role at my university, I had to go through an assessment with an external equality diversity inclusion (EDI) company for them to be validated. It being an externalised and outsourced company was no surprise in the neo-liberal configuration of institutions, but it did make me reflect on how desperate these bodies are not to have disabled people within them. So much so that they have others take care of us for them, others who can take the blame when things go wrong, others who they can keep us from being intimate with, and to stop us from being intimate with them, and others that they can easily cut off when they do not have to follow EDI any more. In this meeting, I spent 40 minutes with a person I had never met before, and have never since. After I had validated my illness through telling them among many such intimate things, including that I didn't drink as it made me sick, they finished the meeting by tell me to \"not take advantage of this access\" and for instance \"go out drinking, and call in sick the next day\". I was astonished by the lack of care and intimacy,, to not even pick up on this basic thing. I firmly reminded them I didn't drink as it made me sick, and also used this place of reaffirming dialogue to remind them that I was very sick, and their report had real implications on my life, so please make it out as it is. She seemed to listen, and the report was very firm and clear.The fact is, often this intimate data is compiled only to lead to inaction, producing what Ruha Benjamin calls the \"datafication of injustice\" (2020, p.&nbsp;117). This is evident when I reflect on the way the institutions of care have computed me on their tables, and held me in their cells. When being tabled in their systems, experts directed how I was. This included GPs over the phone telling me they didn't think my flare up and chronic pain was that urgent, so putting me on a longer waiting list, saying if they changed anything I would still be waiting just as long. This was until I spoke up, a cell was ticked and I was seen in weeks. It also meant that I have to catch a bus or train for 1 hour each way to get my bloods done, as my \"specialist\" doesn't want to do the \"homework\" that means the box will tick so I can get them done by my local GP. Relevant information about my bodily experience and care becomes lost in translation somehow. For example, I repeatedly told medical practitioners about my bodily sensitivities and needs at three points before I was operated on, yet at every point this was not accounted for or recorded. When I asked my specialist at the time about this, after the horrific fallout from this lack of intimacy, which I go onto more in the operating table, he shrugged and said, \"of course\". When I went back again after having passed out from a flashback, told multiple people in A&amp;E I thought I had PTSD from my operation, none of them cared or recorded it. When I next saw my specialist again, he didn't know. In these experiences, I felt this sense that the only thing that was being recorded about me was their observations of me, specifically ones through mechanisms that gave \"exact figures\". How fast was my heartbeat, what was my body mass index, what was the molecular composition of my shit. My specialist summed up their ideology:, \"You understand, as a coder, right? We need more data! Until then, we can't know what is wrong with you\". In response to this I wanted to explain how data is often an undermining factor of what is evidence and who can make it, meaning myy needs were eternally delayed or badly treated, as my embodied data and knowledge was not valid. I was exhausted and coming to from being operated on violently so I couldn't quite make this out to him, nor would he have been intimate with those words. It is also part of this longer history, one where my documents, figures and ex-cell tables from my last hospital had not been transferred over, probably due to the repeated neglect I had experienced there, but also maybe their desire to have this evidence of neglect lost. Either way, this also contributed to me being placed violently on the operating table without the care and intimacy I needed.When I re-orient towards the computing table as someone who has to navigate and access it as a teacher and carer within the academic institution it helps to highlight how some of these dynamics come into relation. To do this I will critique the web interface for the teacher side of a student account, orienting the access of their access needs through computed tables. The interface for the website as a whole is very clunky and complex with many windows, tabs and sub menus to get lost in. I have never been trained in this interface properly, nor has anyone I know.. S4 is an appropriated commerce software that is similar to ones I have encountered when working in retail jobs. No one had shown me where the access needs of students were stored, even after I had done the course on EDI. I asked my manager where they were so I could read up on some of my students' needs. He didn't reply for a while and some of the needs were somewhat urgent, so I asked again. He replied saying that their access needs are confidential, so he couldn't email them to me, but that they were in the interface somewhere, without giving me direction. I eventually bumped into him in the office later that week, and managed to get him to show me where they were. The student access notes, as he showed me, were in a back tab of their student page. The tab was called \"Related\" and the area the essential access information was under was named \"Provisions\". None of this read \"access\" to me, and all of it felt like a barrier. The information held here also felt like it was quite static, and like it might be as equally hard for a student to access and update their needs dynamically as it was for me to find them, potentially leaving this information outdated. When I also tried to link technician who were also responsible for these students through to this access information on S4, they told me that they did not have the permissions to access this information, so I would have to share it with them manually for them to know. All of these social and technical orientations place access and the information someone gives about their own desires and needs around institutional care at the far end of the table and well out of reach, especially out of touch of the possibilities of intimacy and care for their access needs.When I return to S4 to see what it does emphasise in place of access, it is endless figures and values that regulate the student's progress, mainly orienting attendance. As visualised below (+@fig:360), from the university S4 basic PDF guide, there is no space in this 360° student account to hold their access or needs. Instead, when we examine their page there are constant figures on the right, no matter what tab you are on, showing student attendance in both doughnut and line graphs. Even when you are reading their access needs you are still prompted by these figures, and how much a student has been present or not. This is not the only place, as 95% of the interface on their profile and the information around them is also different aspects of their attendance record, but all through filtered gates presented by the teacher, expert and policy maker. This ranged from check in codes that are easily shared to show presence, marks from projects, and approval/denial of applications for things like extenuating circumstances. Again like my own experiences of being computationally tabled in care institutes, these are abstracted figures, taken by others, or configured through datafied logics, denying students' capacities to figure themselves out in relation to their own education and institutional care.<img alt=\"S4 student account visualisation.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:360}I share these frictions to offer up how these computed and automated tables filter and put out of reach people with disabilities, their access knowledges and their agency. It is, as I will go on to say more in the Configure-able Methods chapter, not so much that these tables cannot hold access, but that the experts, specialists and politics that hold these relations in place keep access knowledges, disabilities frictions and their radical criptiques out of reach. Access could be displayed on the student account where the other figures of attendance are, permanent, unavoidable and central to our relation and dialogue with them, but instead it is squeezed frictiously and misfitting into a pre-figured slot in a back tab of a sales software. In my own experiences of being operated on and treated through the computational tables a care institute, there was similarly no clear and effective way for me to communicate my access needs within these ex-cells, as this was configured as \"homework\" by an expect, instead of central to my care and affirmation. This research orients away from this configuration of computed ex-cells that hold, invalidate and hide disability, to instead move towards social and technical practice and relations for these systems that can affirm lives and centre these crip capacities for radical access and care around computing tables.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The computing table","level":2,"id":"The_computing_table_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.02_the_computing_table.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.html"],"createdTime":1756048612767,"modifiedTime":1756048612767,"sourceSize":12794,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.02_The_computing_table.md","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.02_the_computing_table.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.03_the_operating_table.html":{"title":"03.03_The_operating_table","icon":"","description":"Trigger warnings of operations and medical pain etc. Skip to The Crip table if you want to avoid potential triggers.In this section, I will reflect on how the efficiencies of care institutes and health systems leave Crip people on edge waiting for minimal care at any unknown (or unknowable) point. Specifically in my context of the UK National Health Service (NHS), as well as other benefit and care systems that have been heavily underfunded through \"austerity\" politics we can turn to the work of China Mills (2018; Mills &amp; Pring, 2024) to see how the health system has a direct effect on the mental wellbeing and possibility of disabled life under these violent times, policies and politics. Here I will bring into focus my own embodied experiences of these relations, and how they made sense to me as a crip researcher.Here, I could talk for ages about the subtleties and changes in how my injected medicine is scheduled for delivery around the hard efficiencies of the system and not my capacities. Similarly I could turn to how Laura Forlano rubs up against and hacks her medical devices and relations (2023; 2016). I could discuss how I am a cyborg modified with biologics, and connected to a refrigerated delivery pipeline. How this has slowly changed without my input from a relation where the default was a call from a caring person, who would help to guide and talk through the process of arranging your delivery through to the current efficient appified model, that pings, pokes and \"reminds\" you to go through some fiddly forms, which you may not be in a good place to respond to. These sets of relations are complex and situated though, and some people may find this sort of automation frees them up to have more agency over their care, whereas others may find this system cannot care for their needs as it is too generalised.What I want to rub up against here is the neo-liberal catchy rhetoric around ethical automation. I heard the likes of \"a human in the system\" at a UKRI social science conferences, and which through a few words aims to cure the inabilities of automated systems to care. The irony is that there is always \"a person\" within a system if not many, some trying to approach it, some developing and orienting it, as well as the many maintaining it, but all of these positions and more seem to be ignored. By their definition they aim to cure the inabilities of the system by throwing another person in the middle, and this generalised five word slogan cannot specify where they are or what they are doing. You could throw in 100 more people, but if we do not care about how, where or what stuff they are doing, we could be doing them and the people, things and relations they are trying to \"care for\" as much damage as if they were not there. This next section gives a more precise encounter of automation without affirmation that I experienced in my chronic care. The lack of intimacy in this encounter highlights why the work of imagining and orienting towards affirmative infrastructure is so essential.In this section I will recount a recent experience of institutionalised \"care\" that left me with more violent damage to my body than it benefited my well-being. This began when I had my third major flare up of my life. This resulted mainly from being a crip person forced to work over full-time to financially survive when I only have the ability to work part-time. This relational fallout was due to unstable terms, non-existent support networks, both institutional and familial, and the invalidating exhaustive expectations of normative social roles. I have already touched on these causalities and eddies in earlier sections, so here I will orienting more around how in the aftermath of these relations, and when in search of care, it became a struggle to have my needs acknowledge let alone cared for. This reflection is also not meant as a individual tale of a singular crip's treatment, but a place to expand and fabulate from, especially in the UK. It is where I make room and time for us to imagine the industrial scales that the political/relations of institutional care tables operate through.When trying to reach out for help it first has to be noted that I was in the cracks of a system. I was between hospitals, not only due to having moved locations, but also due to me running away from similar mistreatment in my prior specialist department. This left me between pipelines of care and treading water to stay afloat as I flared up with no support beyond taking sick leave and time off of one of my four jobs I had at that time. When reaching out for a referral to my local hospital in Plymouth, both my GP and my previous carers both pointed the finger at each other to initiate this change. After a while I pushed the GP to initiate this move as I did want to get in touch or engage with my old department. They put me through as a standard referral, even though I was badly flared. After a month or two of \"self care\" I finally received a referral letter with no date on it, but telling me to check my contact details, ready for when they would contact me and a date would be given. I decided this was not good enough and pushed the GP to increase my urgency on the referral. In response he said that this was unlikely to do anything and tried to convince me not to do it. In response to this I told him that I was very much living in a reality where these things felt unlikely to change and I just needed him to try and see what would happen. After this strong defending of my needs he agreed to raise the importance of the referral. \"Against all the odds\" this resulted in me getting a call to book in an appointment one week later with my new specialist. In the virtual call with this specialist, he very calmly tried to quell my anxieties by offering me multiple examinations, from a low intrusive MRI, through to an intrusive colonoscopy, both to find out what the \"problem\" is. At the time this did comfort me somewhat but it became obvious that these were just words and none of the care would be non-intrusive.After this meeting I waited a few weeks, and eventually a letter came through the post of another non-dated referral for a colonoscopy. This time though it came with an enema kit, labelled, \"cleen, ready-to-use\" (+@fig:cleen). When I opened it up, I wondered how long, if ever, it would take for me to be given an appointment. The only thing I knew was that when the call came I had to empty my bowls ready for them to violate my body to acquire the data that would validate my pain, and the needs that I had already informed them of verbally.<img alt=\"Cleen and ready-to-use enema kit.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/cleen.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:cleen}A few weeks later, somewhat fortunately, and somewhat stressfully, I received another letter and call from the appointments team informing me that I had been given a slot in just under two weeks' time. Time shifted from an eternity into immediacy, taking me off balance as I was not prepared to experience the same treatment that had left me traumatised years before. The department's preparation for this appointment was again a virtual telephone appointment with a nurse to do the pre-assessment. In this call I tried to vouch for the type of care that I wanted, asking to be sedated as I knew this was a painful experience for me, and expressing that I had been previous difficulties with this procedure. In response the nurse only played down my fears and told me that it would not be as bad as I thought, and encouraged me not to be sedated for the procedure, and just to take gas and air to alleviate minor pain. I still tried to vouch for myself but ended up in a middle ground of trying gas and air, to then turn to sedation if I felt it was too much during the procedure. The thing I find extraordinary, beyond the playing down of my fears, is that when I expressed previous traumatic experiences in this area, they did not think to provide extra care for this, in the forms of providing sedation, nor mental health support going into it. They also did not ask for more information around what happened and how to care for it. Fortunately, I have the capacity to afford a private therapist that I have been seeing for a while and they squeezed me in last minute, and coached me through the upcoming treatment. It would have been very hard without this extra time and care. These extra times though were too much for the institutions of care to afford, and realistically had always been since the start of my disability 7 years prior. This denial of more time to care when we table sensitive bodies and relations in time is a denial and invalidation of the affirmative types of care that these institutions and their efficient capital configurations could hold if configured otherwise.When it came to the day of the procedure, I was lucky enough to have a support network that meant that it was possible for me to be sedated if I needed to be. If I was isolated, like many disabled people are, and without this support system of people to look after me for twenty four hours after the procedure, I would have had to forfeit sedation, as again the institution would not have the time to hold me. As I went in with my friend, we were early to be checked in, so hanging around awkwardly in the corridors of the hospital. When we finally went in to register me, I went to the desk of the department, where I was greeted by, as I guessed by their voice and demeanour, the nurse with whom I had had the phone pre-assessment. Again this interaction seemed to play down my fears and experiences, and pushed me to be squeezed and misfitted into the efficient configures slot of their normative care of gas and air and not be sedated as I had repeatedly asked. After this I waited with my friend, and after 30 minutes I was ushered into another pre-assessment room, where I was quantified, by weight, height and blood pressure, and then left to wait again but by myself.After sitting there for what felt like an eternity, with many thoughts running through my mind, and anxieties growing, I started to question and think about how to again try and advocate for the type of care that would affirm me here. I took small steps to test the waters and capacitiy for wiggle room within what felt like a very hard system. Initially I started by just asking to go to the toilet, which I had not been told where or if I could use. After this small success I had started to build up the momentum to feel like I was able to vouch for the type of care that I really needed. I was eventually taken through to the operating table, where I was briefly introduced to the two men operating on me who I had never met before, nor had a virtual call with. They went on to lay me down and prepare me for the operation, it's hard to remember but it initially felt like my desires to be sedated had not made it through. It was only when I stated the word \"traumatising\" in relation to my prior experiences that his eyes lit up, and he started to take me seriously. It is hard to say here whether that was in relation to providing me with the appropriate care for my situation, or whether it was that by stating these words I had gained leverage by holding him accountable to his actions.I still for some reason felt obliged to try and be shoehorned into the efficient slot of non-sedation, and have the sedation as a backup, something I will not do again. To prepare for this he went to put an IV in my left arm. After having my blood taken many times, every three months for the last 7 years, I am used to the pain and know what to expect, and also get complimented on how easy my veins are to find. As he slipped in, I felt more pain than normal, a sharp sting that I flinched at; as he tried to draw blood it worsened and so did my reaction. Disregarding my response and feelings and after a few more painful attempts to get it to flow he pulled out, telling me that I had not stayed in-line with his needle. I began to cry, feeling no trust in this person, or in how they were about to operate on me. I lay there still. Without a glance he moved to the other arm, and proceeded to try again. This time I was internally trying to stay in-line as much as possible as he slid inside of me. This time it felt the same as any other, and this time I did not flinch.This is also the time that I passed out, not that time at that table, but the time just after writing the last paragraph at this table. Twenty four hours later, writing this having again been treated by the NHS, this time for passing out, for falling from a counter chair, and for hitting my head on the ground. All because I dare to remember that time. I think it's safe to say that I will not be writing about that time, but I can tell you worlds collapsed, sedation through party drugs doubled by bodily violation and immense pain brought memories, spaces and feelings in-line and out of time. I blacked out from pain and I awoke still crying.Waking up on the floor after passing out remembering this, this time. I was assisted by the staff of the coffee shop. They helped me sit up, drink up and come to. They did, however, immediately get me to sign an accident waiver form to make sure that they would be covered around this individual \"problem\". They asked why it happened, I could not say. I texted my friend, and she said she was on her way. When I was doing better I gently walked home, around the corner, where she met me. I felt obliged by norms of rational care to call up 111, the low emergency support number in the UK. I felt okay, and had no clear signs of concussion, but the rationale of their care insisted I go back to the hospital, the same hospital I had remembered. They told me it was urgent, so I should pay for a taxi, but not important enough to send an ambulance, but they would be waiting and ready to receive me. I went in again, they did not know who I was and were not ready for me, sitting there like human livestock, watching people go mad around me in these sick times. I was quantified, I had my vitals taken after a few hours, but nothing said to me, just that it wouldn't be so bad. I waited another few hours with nothing said to me. I finally asked what was going on, they told me I had another 3-4 hours left to be seen. A senior doctor, not in the conversation and with his back to me looked over his shoulder said, \"you should probably go home\". I asked, \"do you know why I am here?\" He did not, even though I had told four people why I had passed out, because I had remembered. Their table of operations could not hold this information. They told me \"that I had decided to come here\", and so \"it was on me\". I told them \"111 had told me to be there\", so I felt like I had to go here, if it was up to me, I would have stayed home from the beginning. They didn't reply, I took a complaints number and left. I still haven't complained because I am not sure what it will do.As I woke up after the last time, crying, in came the \"specialist\" who had done this to me. He told me how my body was, he told me that I was having fast movements, when they were actually very slow, and told me to take medicine to slow me down further. I refused. He told me that I wasn't so inflamed, I told him it had been months since I was, so was starting to settle after my own care. He told me that when you focus on sensing something too much it can start to hurt more than if you ignore it. I had just stopped heavily dissociating from my body that year, and focusing on my body and feelings was helping me to get stable. He tried to get me to take more biological and immunosuppressant medicines as a quick fix. I refused and vouched for the type of care that I wanted: mental, dietary and financial. He looked confused. He then started to prescribe me dietary advice whilst I was still reeling in pain and confusion from this experience, not in a way where it was helpful, but in a way where he reinforced his expertise and role as a \"specialist\". He left, my friend picked me up, with another giving me a lift home.On my own Crip timeline of writing this thesis, it took me a month just to start writing again since being on the operating table, as I could not find the words. No one in those institutions and from that time called me up for aftercare. My bodymind was much worse off after being treated by them and it has taken many more than months to heal it still. These treatments, these performances of efficient industrial care and this experience have still not benefited me in any way so far, just left more scars on my bodymind. I again stepped out from this public institution and into private care, in the form of paying for myself to have a dietitian and try to improve things. This time, I think because I had paid for it, I had someone's time and this time they listened and cared. Over this time, I started to get better again.The \"specialist\" who had done this to me, had, however listened somewhat and gotten me a dietitian from the NHS. This appointment was more disorienting than helpful though. Even though I had been making progress, been gaining weight, been feeling better in my body, they told me that I should stop what I was doing and have a normal diet. That I should just be normal, otherwise I might be doing damage to my own bodymind, and that the feelings and practices I had grown in relation to my expertise where not okay. They didn't give me any advice on how to become \"normal\", just that I should be, and that I should also start eating things that I knew were painful to eat. They also told me I should get on more medication as a quick fix, even though I am not sure they were qualified to recommend this. Quite inappropriately they were also the one to tell me the results that came back from my operation, and that I was still inflamed, even though he had told me I wasn't when I awoke. This was over a month later and no one had reached out to tell me this before. They also told me I had a different condition to what I had been diagnosed with before. I left disenfranchised, disoriented and dissociating.I later had another appointment with my \"specialist\" as a follow up a month or two later than the dietitian. I arrived on time, the appointment was delayed. I waited an hour and a half. He finally made time for me. I went in, and he was already high energy, it was hard for me to orient around this anxious energy. I asked if I could record the meeting to listen back and chat about it with my sister. He said no and started saying I was trying to post him online, and set him up, I was not trying to do this. We ended up getting a nurse to help mediate the conversation. It carried on with this type of dynamic for the entire appointment, with him taking an hour to even \"remember\", acknowledge, and validate what happened in my last operation by him. Continually after this point he tried to make me feel bad for taking more time than my appointment allocated, of needing too much, and trying to shake me off this table. When we finally got past him acknowledging the operation happened we finally turned to future care for me, where he still told me I had a different condition to what I had been told all along. I contested this, but he said he knew, even though he did not have the files from my old hospital, as they had not been transferred. In a later meeting with my specialist nurse, which was actually the first close to affirmative appointment I had, she finally acknowledged that I had the condition I knew I had, and proven through the data my \"specialist\" had misread. She also noted that some of the medication that he had suggested would not have helped, was inappropriate and may have made things worse. The thing I found profound, and which is a sedimented critique of the medical model and pharma-capitol is his normalised move to prescribe very expensive, high side effect, and restraining medication, rather than provide social relational care for me. Instead of listening from the beginning where I asked for a dietitian, a therapist and some space to reorient my bodymind and which cost roughly the same if not less that the medication he wanted to prescribe, this \"data\" was invalidated, to instead go on a deep and violent exploration to the truth of the problem, which I already knew . . . was in the system.I don't recount this as a sympathy plea, as to say that I am the one suffering, or to recourse revenge on the problematic people in these systems, but to make room on this table for this stuff. Compared to other disabled people under the current economic system, I am a relatively financially stable person, and if you know me you know I am also very able and willing to defend my boundaries. I am also white and often perceived as a man by these institutions, which is frustrating, but all these things will orient the type of care I receive. This is one incident in my own life, and sits here as a frictious contour, a misfitting of needs, and a cliff to look over the bodily horizon of these institutions of care. It is to to make room to bring in the background of disability the norms of the institutions invalidate and ignore. Not as a matter of fact, but a fact that matters, and matters more when we fabulate to hold the many stories of people within this industrial grinding down of care. Ones which are much worse than this. Sitting in the A&amp;E for 5 hours was enough to see these lives, these times, and these bodyminds being driven mad and made sick in the presence of institutional care. This institution is not meant to hold all of these lives, experiences and pain, as it was never imagined to. This recollection of the operating table is here to wedge open the door from slamming shut and let these feelings spill through into dialogues of affirmative infrastructures. How can these Crip experiences, practices and wisdoms around institutions, around just refusal and self-advocacy, be in relation to those that wish to operate on us? How can they inform critiques of the current configurations of care and imagine the times, spaces and futures we really need? When I say really need, I mean really need.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The operating table","level":2,"id":"The_operating_table_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.03_the_operating_table.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/cleen.html"],"createdTime":1756048612767,"modifiedTime":1756048612768,"sourceSize":22231,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.03_The_operating_table.md","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.03_the_operating_table.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html":{"title":"03.04_The_crip_table","icon":"","description":"Here is in many ways where I start to turn away from these other tables I have been institutionally forced to be in touch with and instead turn to the crip table that this research orients towards. This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their Rest Assured workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar Life Affirming Organisational Practices (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.<img alt=\"Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:melt}M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as \"an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time\". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's Artist in president talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.<br>The Life Affirming Organisational Practices event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde<a data-footref=\"25\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html#fn-1-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that \"broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems\". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure. <br>\"Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one's own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge.\" - (Lorde, 1997, p.&nbsp;282)<a href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html#fnref-1-6e046d9a93eb7add_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"The crip table","level":2,"id":"The_crip_table_0"}],"links":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html#fn-1-6e046d9a93eb7add_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html#fnref-1-6e046d9a93eb7add_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.html"],"createdTime":1756048612768,"modifiedTime":1756048612768,"sourceSize":9414,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.04_The_crip_table.md","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.05_dancing_with_tables.html":{"title":"03.05_Dancing_with_tables","icon":"","description":"This research in many ways orients a certain dance between these separate, but overlapping institutional tables. In many ways this is framed as a retreat in this work, of trying to put the violences of certain tables out of reach, and orient them towards notions, politics and practices of radical crip life affirmation. In this retreat though, and through a Crip understanding of the cyborg, we are still attached to and entangled with them. Through being in relation with these institutional tables of computing, academia and care, I can also shape them in return. It is this refusal to stay in line and to give feedback where it is not wanted. It is when I come to the operating table and finally talking back to the \"expertise\" of my \"specialist\", not only to refuse medicine and advice that will harm me, but also asking if he had ever read any disability studies? When he said no, I said, \"Don't you think it is interesting you have never listened to the people you care for?\" It is when I come to the computing table and the student account interface and feel the normative urge to police them for their attendance, to instead ask myself, \"How do I care for this person and to be an ally in their building of capacities?\" It is now that I have my own capacity to sit at research tables and send emails telling people what my needs are, and defining good boundaries around them. It is me writing this research and making wiggle room for these reflections and inquiries that maybe give too much information, emotion and anger, but offer within that the capacity to hold these necessary points and times out of line so to disorient and manifest this work from.In this dance I make many mistakes, I am clumsy, I am mad, I am Crip. In this dance I take just a few steps, a couple back, a number sideways. In this dance and between these tables, as I get to grips with them, as they try to shake me off, and as I try to hold on, I build my capacity to reorient them. The shaping effect that some have on me I also have on others, and it is within these frictions, flows, rhythms and moves that this research starts to manifest itself.

I do this through a Crip-Tic of Vignettes, playing on the tych scales, from diptych to triptych to other compositions, and Cripping it to a tic (Maier et al., 2020) to hold the contradictory scales, relations and recursive experiences these times unfold through. Instead of a static or linear scaling as norm the Crip-Tic makes room for these vignettes to be positioned inside, beside and beyond each other, whilst also holding the possibility of more and less crip times to be held in relation. The Crip-Tic also aims to hold these crip times not in a primarily analytical form, which could undermine or filter their stories towards a particular point, but instead holds them as Crip times in all their complexity, forming wiggle room in my thesis for them to be held in relation and refracted through later findings.This assemblage in this research draws out four tics of crip times to orient around and within. Crip times at the academic table, where access is desired but superficial, with little negotiation of or room made for what working with critical access and crip studies entails. Crip times within the computational table, reflecting on the standardised forms and their gaps to fill, the limited choices and obfuscated agencies within computing and the technical systems that we are conformed to by our everyday relations to institutions. Crip times on the operating table, where care as treatment is executed within institutions, and where the medical model invalidates and cures society of the sick through configurations of violence and neglect. After these sections I turn and retreat to crip times at the crip table, the table of disability justice and life affirmation, and one where I have experienced radical sets of crip care and politics in action.\n03.01_The_research_tableIn this section I will talk about experiences of being a Crip in an academic institution in the U.K., and practising within the norms of these research institutes. There are many examples of this within Crip texts, for instance, Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011), but my experiences and tics are contextually specific and form an embodied foundation for this work, the conditions it emerges from and aims to address. I trace the very queer lines of bumping into, running away from, and figuring out what feel like more cozy boundaries in relation to academic institutions. If I return to Ahmed's brief reflection on repetitive strain injury (RSI), how do these paths, these desks and inherited orientations of work determine us to be broken before we even start? In exploring these examples, I aim to open up how academic practices and imaginaries of futures do not imagine us there before we even begin, and in response we need to make lots of Crip trouble so that we can wiggle ourselves in.Accessibility in institutional terms can prevent disabled researchers from being present at the table. For example, at a major science and technology studies conference in 2024, accessibility was reframed, in practice, to mean early career researchers but not disabled people or other intersections of marginalised international communities either. This was enacted through the logic of cutting costs on hybrid access to fund early career researchers. In cutting the hybrid accessibility to the event, disabled people who find it hard to access in person could not easily be in dialogue, but also those with limited access due to geopolitics and border regimes could not be present either. This left some panels with a fraction of their speakers, falling short of being accessible to these broader intersections of un-imagined communities. The conference also had an inclusive set of food tokens for the event, but with my dietaries I could not make use of most of them so ended up paying for my own food on top as well. These everyday examples of inaccessibility in academic spaces and institutional norm build up to larger, sometimes exhausting, patterns that make these spaces unlivable for many.From here, I want to attend in more depth to how academic institutions reproduce what Kafer describes as Crip-less futures. Specifically, I am going to discuss a project in which I wanted to imagine with Crip bodies what a future might be. In this experience I realised that academic institutions often can't feel this Crip stuff in their framings of accessibility, as they keep it at the edge of their reach, with no capacity of being intimate. I was told many times what accessibility is by able bodied people in these institutes, prescribed roles I must follow and spaces and times I must fit to, often with my frictions, labours and issues being hidden from view or easily packaged and moved. In this reflection I share where and how I have taken care of my bodymind and this Crip stuff, in order to speak up to and reorient the institution's deterministic ableist configurations of futures.I applied for a residency with a major research facility, let's call them X - Digital Future Institute (or X-DFI). In placing the X here I retain partial anonymity, but also refer to SoLiXG's definition of XG<a data-footref=\"g1\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-1-3c8e12f13bffd786_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, denoting the infinite growth of digital institutions, infrstructures, and imaginaries. In SoLiXG's case this is the power of big tech network and cloud \"solutions\", and in mine the ever-prevailing ableist institutes of digital futures that will never imagine or be able to hold Crips in their \"infinite\" futures.I originally applied to this residency with the concept of making a crip infrastructure in the form of a server accompanied by a relaxation space. I explained clearly in my application that it was an infrastructure made by and for disabled people that also included a chill space for disabled people to decompress and relax. I expressed clearly my desire that the online space and IRL installation were for crips to have a safe and calm space to collectively imagine what crip futures and practices online might look like. They accepted the project, I was relieved as I could get paid to do some of my own work, and relax about financial stresses. In the first meeting they told me they were chose me because they liked that it was Crip stuff.I was appointed a \"mentor\" who I met up with briefly. We began to chat about the project and work, I discussed for minimum five minutes ideas of creating infrastructures through non-prescriptive methods. He told me he was the method man, he loved methods and it would be great if I could generalise these methods. I didn't feel heard. I carried on talking about network infrastructures, about alternative imaginaries of care around their limits, from a Crip interdependent approach. He said he didn't understand.<br>In the meetings following, the mentor repeatedly questioned the validity of the project and my ability and capacity to make it, instead of caring for its growth. He asked whether a relaxation space was a valid artwork. I tell him there have been many works, by crip artists and others, such as Carmen Papalia's Pain Pals<a data-footref=\"g2\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-2-3c8e12f13bffd786_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, Navild Acosta and Sosa's Black Power Naps<a data-footref=\"g3\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-3-3c8e12f13bffd786_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> and M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured<a data-footref=\"g4\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-4-3c8e12f13bffd786_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> that orient this approach. Each of them talk about different groups needing space to stop from the incessant efficiencies of late capitalism, to sit in and make their own times and to feel safe. It still didn't seem to be valid to him. He again questioned my capacity to make the digital infrastructure, whether I was able to do what I knew I could do (and had done before). Over email, they asked for quantities: , how long the work would be up, how much community I expected? Repeatedly I had to explain what it was, how I was going to make it. Every time, he exclaimed he didn't understand the theory or the practice, and asked for validity again. There was no trust or affirmation of this Crip infrastructure.Initially my \"mentor\" told me verbally that the fee was just for me as payment, and they would cover materials and expenses. I was already putting more work into this infrastructure than the fee entailed, as I cared for this stuff. When it came time to get materials, I sent through expenses, and waited. This was during the period where the validity was being doubted (which was realistically the whole time). I had to send through renders to visualise to them what it might be, and costings of materials which took more care and more time. I waited. I emailed to follow up. I waited. The time of the project stood still, Crip infrastructure frozen in-validity. They replied. The cost of the materials now had to come from my fee, unless they were of value and could be used by the X-DFI in the institution's futures. I told them that this was not okay. A while later they offered a small sum, but I still had to pay the majority for the proposed work. This dialogue froze the project for at least a month, as I could not start until I had the small amount of stuff I needed to care for the work. The fee itself then also got frozen so I had to pay out of my pocket to get going. Due to \"institutional\" delays the payment time had become indefinite, postponed to an unknown date. Due to these delays, I had even less time to care for this stuff.They delayed the submission a bit, but the damage was already done. I did not really trust, through their actions, that this was a place that could hold Crips, or imagined them being here in this X - Digital Future Institute. There was no flexibility in this hard institute for Crips there. The mentorship could not flex to understand, acknowledge or listen to Crip methods, practices and knowledges, and instead turned me into the problem that needed to be cured. Instead of making space for and affirming these imaginaries, however haphazard they might have seemed, they chose to judge it repeatedly, not finding it valid in their terms. Their terms seemed to infantilize what they thought Crips had capacity for, repeatedly asking me to just make something soft for stimming, easily packaged and handled for when they present it to conferences. They didn't want to handle an awkward Crip body or infrastructure. The change of terms to finances also reduced my trust greatly, as it showed they did not understand or legitimise financial accessibility as a barrier, and that their word was not stable. Due to the payment delays, funding changes and my financial precarity I had to take on another job at the same time, developing an app for another research project. This change of terms, and the eddies that flowed in its trail are additive to the stress and relations that caused my last flare up, and why I ended up back on the operating table I mention in the next section.After these initial fallouts, I just kept myself to myself and made the infrastructure on the cheap. Though I in many ways had lost faith in this residency, I carried on mainly for the funding and to make my this crip infrastructure \"against all odds\". So I decided to approah the work as a prototype of what Crip infrastructures might feel like. Using the technical setup I had already knew and developed, but leaving the community out of it whilst the X-DFI voices were still involved. I accompanied this with some cute stickers I rendered and wrote their Alt texts as Crip imaginaries of caring with and for digital network infrastructures. I go on to talk about this infrastructure more in the A Cozier Configure-ability chapter, but in this relation and on top of all the other things I had going on I didn't have the capacity to get them to listen to the nuances of this change or its reasons, so I just didn't communicate it with them.The first payment came through as we were getting ready to display, months late. The accessibility of the space had been miscommunicated, stating there was a lift, then there wasn't one, and then there was, which made me anxious about showing there. It turned out it was fine. In preparation for the show, they began quantifying again, asking questions like, what's the maximum time for a person to relax in the space? They didn't seem to feel time slots undermined crip relaxation or politics. They repeatedly tried to put the work in a small single occupancy tipi, to shade disabled people from the light, and maybe hide us away? It also seemed culturally inappropriate to display my work in, as a white British artist.When it came to the time to show the work, even though we had been promised all along that this would be open to the public, and my application explicitly said the work was for the disabled community, they had not listened and it turned out it was just for a private event for the investors of this new building. It was for an event so private that even we the artists were not invited to it. They used this exhibition as the signing off of the works, and again used it to pressure me into buying my own train tickets and paying for my own expenses to set up the work. By this point, I couldn't be bothered to argue against this.I pitched up to the X-DFI, and was the first one there. I had a nice chat with the receptionist and he offered me a cozy cup of tea. I waited next to a wall of tech company logos. They turned up. We had a tour of the X-DFI, with its brand new facilities in digital twin technology, still half built, with cables and tubes hanging down. It looked expensive, the jewel in the crown of this digital future. I told them it was a dual use technology. They asked what that was. I told them it meant it was made specifically to have both military and commercial uses. They looked surprised. We went upstairs to the open loft space. They had snacks that I couldn't really eat. Luckily, I always bring my own.I started to set up the work, I chose a nice side with good plugs and ports. I got the server connected fine, and the site was up. I pulled out the soft cushy cloud pillows I had made with a collaborator. They looked surprised I had stuff. I placed the easy read, take home text of the cozy intentions on the table. It was installed, it was a very easy setup.Soon after though, they came with stuff. Stuff they wanted to stuff in. I hadn't been told about or consented to this stuff. They brought a weighted blanket, which was nice, but was definitely prescribed, and was for the institution and not for the Cozy-Cloud. Play-dough and colouring in bits, that didn't really fit in and seemed to infantilize disabled people. All of this stuff brought and placed in the space without real dialogue or care. They stepped back, and asked again how accessible the space really is, it seems a little technical for \"disabled\" people and for people from the \"street\". I told them to access the work you just have to try and relax. They didn't. I asked them who the people categorised and figured to be from the street were? I explained I was creating social access to technical practices and processes which in some places of course will be a little technical, but I am trying to make it as accessible as possible. He asked to edit the cozy intentions of the server. I said no. He asked if he was not woke enough. I said I don't think you have the right lived experience to edit a text by and for disabled people. He eventually left me alone.After they had taken their photo op, where I masked a smile, I left my Crip centred space to be shown to the rich investors of this institute, and we went for dinner. We went to a restaurant where they had tried to make it accessible but it still wasn't great for me. I didn't want to cause trouble again so just went anyway. We ate some dinner, I dared to have one dish and we chatted. My \"mentor\" complained about how much free work and excessive stuff he had to do to get anywhere in his career and how much he felt he suffered. I thought he should value and care for his time and capacity more. I chatted to other people around the table. When we were finishing up, he got the whole table's attention and said, \"I really don't think artists suffer enough to make good work anymore\". I stopped. I leaned forward, and I said, \"As someone who lives with chronic pain, I really don't think any value should be placed on suffering\". He suddenly and eventually went quiet. Later after dinner he sent me a text to apologise, I am not sure if he realised what these sedimented politics also meant for him, or if he had felt \"caught out\".I couldn't touch that Crip server for a while after this experience. All of those intentions seemed sullied by this \"mentorship\" and exclusion from the futures of X institutes. The longer term eddies, the subsequent flare up, operations and appointments this experience and its stresses had contributed to meant that trying to make a crip infrastructure for and by crips for relaxation had in fact manifested itself into more crip pain, stress and struggle when in relation to an X Digital future of these institutions. Now, I am moving to care for these scars and tender, frictious relations, to re-orient the spaces I have capacity in so I can work within them cozily. In softer actions I have pulled out one of the Cozy-Cloud cushions and now sleep with it, dreaming of X-C/CFI (Crip/cozy future infrastructures) most nights. This experience is one that has made me care even more for where I table my Crip stuff. Are academic institutions able to, or do theyeven desire to hold this Crip stuff? Or will their values, politics, relations and orientations always hold it out of reach and disable them from caring for the stuff of Crip futures? <br>\"\"XG\" is an industry term for anticipatory technological iteration that we in SoLiXG extend to capture the process of developing, expanding and maintaining digital infrastructures, always with an eye to the next generation.

I am approaching this through two avenues here, though there are many other approaches I could take. The first is to reflect on how I as an individual have systemically by multiple institutions been placed and prescribed to specific cells within tables by others as they translate my experience into evidence to validate my care. Here I am thinking this through with Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). I will also reflect on how I as a teacher and carer for students have found the computational interface of access, and the social relations of students' access needs often hidden or held out of reach, making it harder to care for their access out of the norms of these institutions.The first step is opening the tab on how I have been categorised, documented and (in)validated by both academic and care institutes. Within both there has always been a separation between me and my embodied knowing of my experience, and the computational cells that it is put into. This separation is carried out by the \"expert\" or the \"specialist\" who \"knows\" what I am experiencing better than I do, and who will translate and filter it into the abstract syntax and figures that are valid within these political systems and institutional relations. All of these orientations take what has happened to me, how I feel about it and the sense I make from it, and de-legitimise and invalidate them, to instead be stated in the abstract words and figures they have sedimented out of reach of me. It is also with the understated and normalised violence through which these invalidating logics are instrumentalised. This has manifested for me as 9 years of my specialist and carers denying my chronic pain, as \"studies and figures show that part of my body doesn't have pain receptors\". This is until recently, when another cell has been ticked even further out of my reach, and certain medications for chronic pain have been legalised, and so seemingly has my pain. It is also that another \"expert\" regulating my workplace stress and need for access, and who was mediating the input into its validating ex-cell table, was a manager who was additive to my workplace stress. When I asked (as I had a number of times before) if he could invite me to the relevant staff meetings for me, as I was part time, his reasonable adjustment was instead to tell me to come to every third one. In reflection this left me more anxious as I still wasn't sure which to go to, or if I would get in the way. I also reflected to myself here how meeting invites are a fairly standard practice, and the computed table of the calendar event had space for this invitation, but instead he just refused to action this.Here, I approach the computing table through Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). For her, this concept covers the many ways that people with disabilities in need of direct physical care, can be forced into intimate contact with those around them, who can often be strangers. She also widens this scope to think similarly about how disabled people often have to give up intimate information about ourselves to validate our access needs, and yet often still don't have them met in return. Little care is given to these relations within computing tables. When working through getting my access needs recognised, and reasonable adjustments made for my teaching role at my university, I had to go through an assessment with an external equality diversity inclusion (EDI) company for them to be validated. It being an externalised and outsourced company was no surprise in the neo-liberal configuration of institutions, but it did make me reflect on how desperate these bodies are not to have disabled people within them. So much so that they have others take care of us for them, others who can take the blame when things go wrong, others who they can keep us from being intimate with, and to stop us from being intimate with them, and others that they can easily cut off when they do not have to follow EDI any more. In this meeting, I spent 40 minutes with a person I had never met before, and have never since. After I had validated my illness through telling them among many such intimate things, including that I didn't drink as it made me sick, they finished the meeting by tell me to \"not take advantage of this access\" and for instance \"go out drinking, and call in sick the next day\". I was astonished by the lack of care and intimacy,, to not even pick up on this basic thing. I firmly reminded them I didn't drink as it made me sick, and also used this place of reaffirming dialogue to remind them that I was very sick, and their report had real implications on my life, so please make it out as it is. She seemed to listen, and the report was very firm and clear.The fact is, often this intimate data is compiled only to lead to inaction, producing what Ruha Benjamin calls the \"datafication of injustice\" (2020, p.&nbsp;117). This is evident when I reflect on the way the institutions of care have computed me on their tables, and held me in their cells. When being tabled in their systems, experts directed how I was. This included GPs over the phone telling me they didn't think my flare up and chronic pain was that urgent, so putting me on a longer waiting list, saying if they changed anything I would still be waiting just as long. This was until I spoke up, a cell was ticked and I was seen in weeks. It also meant that I have to catch a bus or train for 1 hour each way to get my bloods done, as my \"specialist\" doesn't want to do the \"homework\" that means the box will tick so I can get them done by my local GP. Relevant information about my bodily experience and care becomes lost in translation somehow. For example, I repeatedly told medical practitioners about my bodily sensitivities and needs at three points before I was operated on, yet at every point this was not accounted for or recorded. When I asked my specialist at the time about this, after the horrific fallout from this lack of intimacy, which I go onto more in the operating table, he shrugged and said, \"of course\". When I went back again after having passed out from a flashback, told multiple people in A&amp;E I thought I had PTSD from my operation, none of them cared or recorded it. When I next saw my specialist again, he didn't know. In these experiences, I felt this sense that the only thing that was being recorded about me was their observations of me, specifically ones through mechanisms that gave \"exact figures\". How fast was my heartbeat, what was my body mass index, what was the molecular composition of my shit. My specialist summed up their ideology:, \"You understand, as a coder, right? We need more data! Until then, we can't know what is wrong with you\". In response to this I wanted to explain how data is often an undermining factor of what is evidence and who can make it, meaning myy needs were eternally delayed or badly treated, as my embodied data and knowledge was not valid. I was exhausted and coming to from being operated on violently so I couldn't quite make this out to him, nor would he have been intimate with those words. It is also part of this longer history, one where my documents, figures and ex-cell tables from my last hospital had not been transferred over, probably due to the repeated neglect I had experienced there, but also maybe their desire to have this evidence of neglect lost. Either way, this also contributed to me being placed violently on the operating table without the care and intimacy I needed.When I re-orient towards the computing table as someone who has to navigate and access it as a teacher and carer within the academic institution it helps to highlight how some of these dynamics come into relation. To do this I will critique the web interface for the teacher side of a student account, orienting the access of their access needs through computed tables. The interface for the website as a whole is very clunky and complex with many windows, tabs and sub menus to get lost in. I have never been trained in this interface properly, nor has anyone I know.. S4 is an appropriated commerce software that is similar to ones I have encountered when working in retail jobs. No one had shown me where the access needs of students were stored, even after I had done the course on EDI. I asked my manager where they were so I could read up on some of my students' needs. He didn't reply for a while and some of the needs were somewhat urgent, so I asked again. He replied saying that their access needs are confidential, so he couldn't email them to me, but that they were in the interface somewhere, without giving me direction. I eventually bumped into him in the office later that week, and managed to get him to show me where they were. The student access notes, as he showed me, were in a back tab of their student page. The tab was called \"Related\" and the area the essential access information was under was named \"Provisions\". None of this read \"access\" to me, and all of it felt like a barrier. The information held here also felt like it was quite static, and like it might be as equally hard for a student to access and update their needs dynamically as it was for me to find them, potentially leaving this information outdated. When I also tried to link technician who were also responsible for these students through to this access information on S4, they told me that they did not have the permissions to access this information, so I would have to share it with them manually for them to know. All of these social and technical orientations place access and the information someone gives about their own desires and needs around institutional care at the far end of the table and well out of reach, especially out of touch of the possibilities of intimacy and care for their access needs.When I return to S4 to see what it does emphasise in place of access, it is endless figures and values that regulate the student's progress, mainly orienting attendance. As visualised below (+@fig:360), from the university S4 basic PDF guide, there is no space in this 360° student account to hold their access or needs. Instead, when we examine their page there are constant figures on the right, no matter what tab you are on, showing student attendance in both doughnut and line graphs. Even when you are reading their access needs you are still prompted by these figures, and how much a student has been present or not. This is not the only place, as 95% of the interface on their profile and the information around them is also different aspects of their attendance record, but all through filtered gates presented by the teacher, expert and policy maker. This ranged from check in codes that are easily shared to show presence, marks from projects, and approval/denial of applications for things like extenuating circumstances. Again like my own experiences of being computationally tabled in care institutes, these are abstracted figures, taken by others, or configured through datafied logics, denying students' capacities to figure themselves out in relation to their own education and institutional care.<br><img alt=\"S4 student account visualisation.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:360}I share these frictions to offer up how these computed and automated tables filter and put out of reach people with disabilities, their access knowledges and their agency. It is, as I will go on to say more in the Configure-able Methods chapter, not so much that these tables cannot hold access, but that the experts, specialists and politics that hold these relations in place keep access knowledges, disabilities frictions and their radical criptiques out of reach. Access could be displayed on the student account where the other figures of attendance are, permanent, unavoidable and central to our relation and dialogue with them, but instead it is squeezed frictiously and misfitting into a pre-figured slot in a back tab of a sales software. In my own experiences of being operated on and treated through the computational tables a care institute, there was similarly no clear and effective way for me to communicate my access needs within these ex-cells, as this was configured as \"homework\" by an expect, instead of central to my care and affirmation. This research orients away from this configuration of computed ex-cells that hold, invalidate and hide disability, to instead move towards social and technical practice and relations for these systems that can affirm lives and centre these crip capacities for radical access and care around computing tables.\n03.03_The_operating_table\n03.04_The_crip_tableHere is in many ways where I start to turn away from these other tables I have been institutionally forced to be in touch with and instead turn to the crip table that this research orients towards. This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their Rest Assured workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar Life Affirming Organisational Practices (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.<br><img alt=\"Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:melt}M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as \"an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time\". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's Artist in president talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.<br>The Life Affirming Organisational Practices event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde<a data-footref=\"25\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-1-38bae027f9b0fccc_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that \"broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems\". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure. <br>\"Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one's own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge.\" - (Lorde, 1997, p.&nbsp;282)<a href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-1-38bae027f9b0fccc_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 03.05_Dancing_with_tablesThis research in many ways orients a certain dance between these separate, but overlapping institutional tables. In many ways this is framed as a retreat in this work, of trying to put the violences of certain tables out of reach, and orient them towards notions, politics and practices of radical crip life affirmation. In this retreat though, and through a Crip understanding of the cyborg, we are still attached to and entangled with them. Through being in relation with these institutional tables of computing, academia and care, I can also shape them in return. It is this refusal to stay in line and to give feedback where it is not wanted. It is when I come to the operating table and finally talking back to the \"expertise\" of my \"specialist\", not only to refuse medicine and advice that will harm me, but also asking if he had ever read any disability studies? When he said no, I said, \"Don't you think it is interesting you have never listened to the people you care for?\" It is when I come to the computing table and the student account interface and feel the normative urge to police them for their attendance, to instead ask myself, \"How do I care for this person and to be an ally in their building of capacities?\" It is now that I have my own capacity to sit at research tables and send emails telling people what my needs are, and defining good boundaries around them. It is me writing this research and making wiggle room for these reflections and inquiries that maybe give too much information, emotion and anger, but offer within that the capacity to hold these necessary points and times out of line so to disorient and manifest this work from.In this dance I make many mistakes, I am clumsy, I am mad, I am Crip. In this dance I take just a few steps, a couple back, a number sideways. In this dance and between these tables, as I get to grips with them, as they try to shake me off, and as I try to hold on, I build my capacity to reorient them. The shaping effect that some have on me I also have on others, and it is within these frictions, flows, rhythms and moves that this research starts to manifest itself. Again, not through one point but a repetitive Crip-Tic and recursive practice of wiggling room within, between and around the capacities of these hard systems and institutes for our communities and their many tables to be cozily in relation.\npandoc_orderinput-files:\n./03.00_Intro.md\n./03.01_The_research_table.md\n./03.02_The_computing_table.md\n./03.03_The_operating_table.md\n./03.04_The_crip_table.md\n./03.05_Dancing_with_tables.md\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas\" href=\"03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Configuration</a>","level":1,"id":"[Configuration](03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas)_0"},{"heading":"Entries","level":1,"id":"Entries_0"},{"heading":"Crip-Tic of vignettes","level":7,"id":"Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_0"},{"heading":"The research table","level":8,"id":"The_research_table_0"},{"heading":"The computing table","level":8,"id":"The_computing_table_0"},{"heading":"The crip table","level":8,"id":"The_crip_table_0"},{"heading":"Dancing with tables","level":8,"id":"Dancing_with_tables_0"}],"links":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-1-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-2-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-3-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-4-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-1-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-2-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-3-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-4-3c8e12f13bffd786_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fn-1-38bae027f9b0fccc_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html#fnref-1-38bae027f9b0fccc_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.00_intro.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.02_the_computing_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.03_the_operating_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.05_dancing_with_tables.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/pandoc_order.html"],"createdTime":1756048612765,"modifiedTime":1756048612765,"sourceSize":394,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html":{"title":"03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas","icon":"","description":" 03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas\n03.01_The_research_table\n03.02_The_computing_table\n03.03_The_operating_table\n03.04_The_crip_table\n03.05_Dancing_with_tables\npandoc_order03_Crip-Tic_of_VignettesIn this section I will talk about experiences of being a Crip in an academic institution in the U.K., and practising within the norms of these research institutes. There are many examples of this within Crip texts, for instance, Margaret Price's Mad at School (2011), but my experiences and tics are contextually specific and form an embodied foundation for this work, the conditions it emerges from and aims to address. I trace the very queer lines of bumping into, running away from, and figuring out what feel like more cozy boundaries in relation to academic institutions. If I return to Ahmed's brief reflection on repetitive strain injury (RSI), how do these paths, these desks and inherited orientations of work determine us to be broken before we even start? In exploring these examples, I aim to open up how academic practices and imaginaries of futures do not imagine us there before we even begin, and in response we need to make lots of Crip trouble so that we can wiggle ourselves in.Accessibility in institutional terms can prevent disabled researchers from being present at the table. For example, at a major science and technology studies conference in 2024, accessibility was reframed, in practice, to mean early career researchers but not disabled people or other intersections of marginalised international communities either. This was enacted through the logic of cutting costs on hybrid access to fund early career researchers. In cutting the hybrid accessibility to the event, disabled people who find it hard to access in person could not easily be in dialogue, but also those with limited access due to geopolitics and border regimes could not be present either. This left some panels with a fraction of their speakers, falling short of being accessible to these broader intersections of un-imagined communities. The conference also had an inclusive set of food tokens for the event, but with my dietaries I could not make use of most of them so ended up paying for my own food on top as well. These everyday examples of inaccessibility in academic spaces and institutional norm build up to larger, sometimes exhausting, patterns that make these spaces unlivable for many.From here, I want to attend in more depth to how academic institutions reproduce what Kafer describes as Crip-less futures. Specifically, I am going to discuss a project in which I wanted to imagine with Crip bodies what a future might be. In this experience I realised that academic institutions often can't feel this Crip stuff in their framings of accessibility, as they keep it at the edge of their reach, with no capacity of being intimate. I was told many times what accessibility is by able bodied people in these institutes, prescribed roles I must follow and spaces and times I must fit to, often with my frictions, labours and issues being hidden from view or easily packaged and moved. In this reflection I share where and how I have taken care of my bodymind and this Crip stuff, in order to speak up to and reorient the institution's deterministic ableist configurations of futures.I applied for a residency with a major research facility, let's call them X - Digital Future Institute (or X-DFI). In placing the X here I retain partial anonymity, but also refer to SoLiXG's definition of XG<a data-footref=\"g1\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-1-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, denoting the infinite growth of digital institutions, infrstructures, and imaginaries. In SoLiXG's case this is the power of big tech network and cloud \"solutions\", and in mine the ever-prevailing ableist institutes of digital futures that will never imagine or be able to hold Crips in their \"infinite\" futures.I originally applied to this residency with the concept of making a crip infrastructure in the form of a server accompanied by a relaxation space. I explained clearly in my application that it was an infrastructure made by and for disabled people that also included a chill space for disabled people to decompress and relax. I expressed clearly my desire that the online space and IRL installation were for crips to have a safe and calm space to collectively imagine what crip futures and practices online might look like. They accepted the project, I was relieved as I could get paid to do some of my own work, and relax about financial stresses. In the first meeting they told me they were chose me because they liked that it was Crip stuff.I was appointed a \"mentor\" who I met up with briefly. We began to chat about the project and work, I discussed for minimum five minutes ideas of creating infrastructures through non-prescriptive methods. He told me he was the method man, he loved methods and it would be great if I could generalise these methods. I didn't feel heard. I carried on talking about network infrastructures, about alternative imaginaries of care around their limits, from a Crip interdependent approach. He said he didn't understand.<br>In the meetings following, the mentor repeatedly questioned the validity of the project and my ability and capacity to make it, instead of caring for its growth. He asked whether a relaxation space was a valid artwork. I tell him there have been many works, by crip artists and others, such as Carmen Papalia's Pain Pals<a data-footref=\"g2\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-2-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, Navild Acosta and Sosa's Black Power Naps<a data-footref=\"g3\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-3-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> and M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured<a data-footref=\"g4\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-4-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> that orient this approach. Each of them talk about different groups needing space to stop from the incessant efficiencies of late capitalism, to sit in and make their own times and to feel safe. It still didn't seem to be valid to him. He again questioned my capacity to make the digital infrastructure, whether I was able to do what I knew I could do (and had done before). Over email, they asked for quantities: , how long the work would be up, how much community I expected? Repeatedly I had to explain what it was, how I was going to make it. Every time, he exclaimed he didn't understand the theory or the practice, and asked for validity again. There was no trust or affirmation of this Crip infrastructure.Initially my \"mentor\" told me verbally that the fee was just for me as payment, and they would cover materials and expenses. I was already putting more work into this infrastructure than the fee entailed, as I cared for this stuff. When it came time to get materials, I sent through expenses, and waited. This was during the period where the validity was being doubted (which was realistically the whole time). I had to send through renders to visualise to them what it might be, and costings of materials which took more care and more time. I waited. I emailed to follow up. I waited. The time of the project stood still, Crip infrastructure frozen in-validity. They replied. The cost of the materials now had to come from my fee, unless they were of value and could be used by the X-DFI in the institution's futures. I told them that this was not okay. A while later they offered a small sum, but I still had to pay the majority for the proposed work. This dialogue froze the project for at least a month, as I could not start until I had the small amount of stuff I needed to care for the work. The fee itself then also got frozen so I had to pay out of my pocket to get going. Due to \"institutional\" delays the payment time had become indefinite, postponed to an unknown date. Due to these delays, I had even less time to care for this stuff.They delayed the submission a bit, but the damage was already done. I did not really trust, through their actions, that this was a place that could hold Crips, or imagined them being here in this X - Digital Future Institute. There was no flexibility in this hard institute for Crips there. The mentorship could not flex to understand, acknowledge or listen to Crip methods, practices and knowledges, and instead turned me into the problem that needed to be cured. Instead of making space for and affirming these imaginaries, however haphazard they might have seemed, they chose to judge it repeatedly, not finding it valid in their terms. Their terms seemed to infantilize what they thought Crips had capacity for, repeatedly asking me to just make something soft for stimming, easily packaged and handled for when they present it to conferences. They didn't want to handle an awkward Crip body or infrastructure. The change of terms to finances also reduced my trust greatly, as it showed they did not understand or legitimise financial accessibility as a barrier, and that their word was not stable. Due to the payment delays, funding changes and my financial precarity I had to take on another job at the same time, developing an app for another research project. This change of terms, and the eddies that flowed in its trail are additive to the stress and relations that caused my last flare up, and why I ended up back on the operating table I mention in the next section.After these initial fallouts, I just kept myself to myself and made the infrastructure on the cheap. Though I in many ways had lost faith in this residency, I carried on mainly for the funding and to make my this crip infrastructure \"against all odds\". So I decided to approah the work as a prototype of what Crip infrastructures might feel like. Using the technical setup I had already knew and developed, but leaving the community out of it whilst the X-DFI voices were still involved. I accompanied this with some cute stickers I rendered and wrote their Alt texts as Crip imaginaries of caring with and for digital network infrastructures. I go on to talk about this infrastructure more in the A Cozier Configure-ability chapter, but in this relation and on top of all the other things I had going on I didn't have the capacity to get them to listen to the nuances of this change or its reasons, so I just didn't communicate it with them.The first payment came through as we were getting ready to display, months late. The accessibility of the space had been miscommunicated, stating there was a lift, then there wasn't one, and then there was, which made me anxious about showing there. It turned out it was fine. In preparation for the show, they began quantifying again, asking questions like, what's the maximum time for a person to relax in the space? They didn't seem to feel time slots undermined crip relaxation or politics. They repeatedly tried to put the work in a small single occupancy tipi, to shade disabled people from the light, and maybe hide us away? It also seemed culturally inappropriate to display my work in, as a white British artist.When it came to the time to show the work, even though we had been promised all along that this would be open to the public, and my application explicitly said the work was for the disabled community, they had not listened and it turned out it was just for a private event for the investors of this new building. It was for an event so private that even we the artists were not invited to it. They used this exhibition as the signing off of the works, and again used it to pressure me into buying my own train tickets and paying for my own expenses to set up the work. By this point, I couldn't be bothered to argue against this.I pitched up to the X-DFI, and was the first one there. I had a nice chat with the receptionist and he offered me a cozy cup of tea. I waited next to a wall of tech company logos. They turned up. We had a tour of the X-DFI, with its brand new facilities in digital twin technology, still half built, with cables and tubes hanging down. It looked expensive, the jewel in the crown of this digital future. I told them it was a dual use technology. They asked what that was. I told them it meant it was made specifically to have both military and commercial uses. They looked surprised. We went upstairs to the open loft space. They had snacks that I couldn't really eat. Luckily, I always bring my own.I started to set up the work, I chose a nice side with good plugs and ports. I got the server connected fine, and the site was up. I pulled out the soft cushy cloud pillows I had made with a collaborator. They looked surprised I had stuff. I placed the easy read, take home text of the cozy intentions on the table. It was installed, it was a very easy setup.Soon after though, they came with stuff. Stuff they wanted to stuff in. I hadn't been told about or consented to this stuff. They brought a weighted blanket, which was nice, but was definitely prescribed, and was for the institution and not for the Cozy-Cloud. Play-dough and colouring in bits, that didn't really fit in and seemed to infantilize disabled people. All of this stuff brought and placed in the space without real dialogue or care. They stepped back, and asked again how accessible the space really is, it seems a little technical for \"disabled\" people and for people from the \"street\". I told them to access the work you just have to try and relax. They didn't. I asked them who the people categorised and figured to be from the street were? I explained I was creating social access to technical practices and processes which in some places of course will be a little technical, but I am trying to make it as accessible as possible. He asked to edit the cozy intentions of the server. I said no. He asked if he was not woke enough. I said I don't think you have the right lived experience to edit a text by and for disabled people. He eventually left me alone.After they had taken their photo op, where I masked a smile, I left my Crip centred space to be shown to the rich investors of this institute, and we went for dinner. We went to a restaurant where they had tried to make it accessible but it still wasn't great for me. I didn't want to cause trouble again so just went anyway. We ate some dinner, I dared to have one dish and we chatted. My \"mentor\" complained about how much free work and excessive stuff he had to do to get anywhere in his career and how much he felt he suffered. I thought he should value and care for his time and capacity more. I chatted to other people around the table. When we were finishing up, he got the whole table's attention and said, \"I really don't think artists suffer enough to make good work anymore\". I stopped. I leaned forward, and I said, \"As someone who lives with chronic pain, I really don't think any value should be placed on suffering\". He suddenly and eventually went quiet. Later after dinner he sent me a text to apologise, I am not sure if he realised what these sedimented politics also meant for him, or if he had felt \"caught out\".I couldn't touch that Crip server for a while after this experience. All of those intentions seemed sullied by this \"mentorship\" and exclusion from the futures of X institutes. The longer term eddies, the subsequent flare up, operations and appointments this experience and its stresses had contributed to meant that trying to make a crip infrastructure for and by crips for relaxation had in fact manifested itself into more crip pain, stress and struggle when in relation to an X Digital future of these institutions. Now, I am moving to care for these scars and tender, frictious relations, to re-orient the spaces I have capacity in so I can work within them cozily. In softer actions I have pulled out one of the Cozy-Cloud cushions and now sleep with it, dreaming of X-C/CFI (Crip/cozy future infrastructures) most nights. This experience is one that has made me care even more for where I table my Crip stuff. Are academic institutions able to, or do theyeven desire to hold this Crip stuff? Or will their values, politics, relations and orientations always hold it out of reach and disable them from caring for the stuff of Crip futures? <br>\"\"XG\" is an industry term for anticipatory technological iteration that we in SoLiXG extend to capture the process of developing, expanding and maintaining digital infrastructures, always with an eye to the next generation.

I am approaching this through two avenues here, though there are many other approaches I could take. The first is to reflect on how I as an individual have systemically by multiple institutions been placed and prescribed to specific cells within tables by others as they translate my experience into evidence to validate my care. Here I am thinking this through with Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). I will also reflect on how I as a teacher and carer for students have found the computational interface of access, and the social relations of students' access needs often hidden or held out of reach, making it harder to care for their access out of the norms of these institutions.The first step is opening the tab on how I have been categorised, documented and (in)validated by both academic and care institutes. Within both there has always been a separation between me and my embodied knowing of my experience, and the computational cells that it is put into. This separation is carried out by the \"expert\" or the \"specialist\" who \"knows\" what I am experiencing better than I do, and who will translate and filter it into the abstract syntax and figures that are valid within these political systems and institutional relations. All of these orientations take what has happened to me, how I feel about it and the sense I make from it, and de-legitimise and invalidate them, to instead be stated in the abstract words and figures they have sedimented out of reach of me. It is also with the understated and normalised violence through which these invalidating logics are instrumentalised. This has manifested for me as 9 years of my specialist and carers denying my chronic pain, as \"studies and figures show that part of my body doesn't have pain receptors\". This is until recently, when another cell has been ticked even further out of my reach, and certain medications for chronic pain have been legalised, and so seemingly has my pain. It is also that another \"expert\" regulating my workplace stress and need for access, and who was mediating the input into its validating ex-cell table, was a manager who was additive to my workplace stress. When I asked (as I had a number of times before) if he could invite me to the relevant staff meetings for me, as I was part time, his reasonable adjustment was instead to tell me to come to every third one. In reflection this left me more anxious as I still wasn't sure which to go to, or if I would get in the way. I also reflected to myself here how meeting invites are a fairly standard practice, and the computed table of the calendar event had space for this invitation, but instead he just refused to action this.Here, I approach the computing table through Mia Mingus' Forced Intimacy (2017). For her, this concept covers the many ways that people with disabilities in need of direct physical care, can be forced into intimate contact with those around them, who can often be strangers. She also widens this scope to think similarly about how disabled people often have to give up intimate information about ourselves to validate our access needs, and yet often still don't have them met in return. Little care is given to these relations within computing tables. When working through getting my access needs recognised, and reasonable adjustments made for my teaching role at my university, I had to go through an assessment with an external equality diversity inclusion (EDI) company for them to be validated. It being an externalised and outsourced company was no surprise in the neo-liberal configuration of institutions, but it did make me reflect on how desperate these bodies are not to have disabled people within them. So much so that they have others take care of us for them, others who can take the blame when things go wrong, others who they can keep us from being intimate with, and to stop us from being intimate with them, and others that they can easily cut off when they do not have to follow EDI any more. In this meeting, I spent 40 minutes with a person I had never met before, and have never since. After I had validated my illness through telling them among many such intimate things, including that I didn't drink as it made me sick, they finished the meeting by tell me to \"not take advantage of this access\" and for instance \"go out drinking, and call in sick the next day\". I was astonished by the lack of care and intimacy,, to not even pick up on this basic thing. I firmly reminded them I didn't drink as it made me sick, and also used this place of reaffirming dialogue to remind them that I was very sick, and their report had real implications on my life, so please make it out as it is. She seemed to listen, and the report was very firm and clear.The fact is, often this intimate data is compiled only to lead to inaction, producing what Ruha Benjamin calls the \"datafication of injustice\" (2020, p.&nbsp;117). This is evident when I reflect on the way the institutions of care have computed me on their tables, and held me in their cells. When being tabled in their systems, experts directed how I was. This included GPs over the phone telling me they didn't think my flare up and chronic pain was that urgent, so putting me on a longer waiting list, saying if they changed anything I would still be waiting just as long. This was until I spoke up, a cell was ticked and I was seen in weeks. It also meant that I have to catch a bus or train for 1 hour each way to get my bloods done, as my \"specialist\" doesn't want to do the \"homework\" that means the box will tick so I can get them done by my local GP. Relevant information about my bodily experience and care becomes lost in translation somehow. For example, I repeatedly told medical practitioners about my bodily sensitivities and needs at three points before I was operated on, yet at every point this was not accounted for or recorded. When I asked my specialist at the time about this, after the horrific fallout from this lack of intimacy, which I go onto more in the operating table, he shrugged and said, \"of course\". When I went back again after having passed out from a flashback, told multiple people in A&amp;E I thought I had PTSD from my operation, none of them cared or recorded it. When I next saw my specialist again, he didn't know. In these experiences, I felt this sense that the only thing that was being recorded about me was their observations of me, specifically ones through mechanisms that gave \"exact figures\". How fast was my heartbeat, what was my body mass index, what was the molecular composition of my shit. My specialist summed up their ideology:, \"You understand, as a coder, right? We need more data! Until then, we can't know what is wrong with you\". In response to this I wanted to explain how data is often an undermining factor of what is evidence and who can make it, meaning myy needs were eternally delayed or badly treated, as my embodied data and knowledge was not valid. I was exhausted and coming to from being operated on violently so I couldn't quite make this out to him, nor would he have been intimate with those words. It is also part of this longer history, one where my documents, figures and ex-cell tables from my last hospital had not been transferred over, probably due to the repeated neglect I had experienced there, but also maybe their desire to have this evidence of neglect lost. Either way, this also contributed to me being placed violently on the operating table without the care and intimacy I needed.When I re-orient towards the computing table as someone who has to navigate and access it as a teacher and carer within the academic institution it helps to highlight how some of these dynamics come into relation. To do this I will critique the web interface for the teacher side of a student account, orienting the access of their access needs through computed tables. The interface for the website as a whole is very clunky and complex with many windows, tabs and sub menus to get lost in. I have never been trained in this interface properly, nor has anyone I know.. S4 is an appropriated commerce software that is similar to ones I have encountered when working in retail jobs. No one had shown me where the access needs of students were stored, even after I had done the course on EDI. I asked my manager where they were so I could read up on some of my students' needs. He didn't reply for a while and some of the needs were somewhat urgent, so I asked again. He replied saying that their access needs are confidential, so he couldn't email them to me, but that they were in the interface somewhere, without giving me direction. I eventually bumped into him in the office later that week, and managed to get him to show me where they were. The student access notes, as he showed me, were in a back tab of their student page. The tab was called \"Related\" and the area the essential access information was under was named \"Provisions\". None of this read \"access\" to me, and all of it felt like a barrier. The information held here also felt like it was quite static, and like it might be as equally hard for a student to access and update their needs dynamically as it was for me to find them, potentially leaving this information outdated. When I also tried to link technician who were also responsible for these students through to this access information on S4, they told me that they did not have the permissions to access this information, so I would have to share it with them manually for them to know. All of these social and technical orientations place access and the information someone gives about their own desires and needs around institutional care at the far end of the table and well out of reach, especially out of touch of the possibilities of intimacy and care for their access needs.When I return to S4 to see what it does emphasise in place of access, it is endless figures and values that regulate the student's progress, mainly orienting attendance. As visualised below (+@fig:360), from the university S4 basic PDF guide, there is no space in this 360° student account to hold their access or needs. Instead, when we examine their page there are constant figures on the right, no matter what tab you are on, showing student attendance in both doughnut and line graphs. Even when you are reading their access needs you are still prompted by these figures, and how much a student has been present or not. This is not the only place, as 95% of the interface on their profile and the information around them is also different aspects of their attendance record, but all through filtered gates presented by the teacher, expert and policy maker. This ranged from check in codes that are easily shared to show presence, marks from projects, and approval/denial of applications for things like extenuating circumstances. Again like my own experiences of being computationally tabled in care institutes, these are abstracted figures, taken by others, or configured through datafied logics, denying students' capacities to figure themselves out in relation to their own education and institutional care.<br><img alt=\"S4 student account visualisation.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:360}I share these frictions to offer up how these computed and automated tables filter and put out of reach people with disabilities, their access knowledges and their agency. It is, as I will go on to say more in the Configure-able Methods chapter, not so much that these tables cannot hold access, but that the experts, specialists and politics that hold these relations in place keep access knowledges, disabilities frictions and their radical criptiques out of reach. Access could be displayed on the student account where the other figures of attendance are, permanent, unavoidable and central to our relation and dialogue with them, but instead it is squeezed frictiously and misfitting into a pre-figured slot in a back tab of a sales software. In my own experiences of being operated on and treated through the computational tables a care institute, there was similarly no clear and effective way for me to communicate my access needs within these ex-cells, as this was configured as \"homework\" by an expect, instead of central to my care and affirmation. This research orients away from this configuration of computed ex-cells that hold, invalidate and hide disability, to instead move towards social and technical practice and relations for these systems that can affirm lives and centre these crip capacities for radical access and care around computing tables.03.02_The_computing_tableTrigger warnings of operations and medical pain etc. Skip to The Crip table if you want to avoid potential triggers.In this section, I will reflect on how the efficiencies of care institutes and health systems leave Crip people on edge waiting for minimal care at any unknown (or unknowable) point. Specifically in my context of the UK National Health Service (NHS), as well as other benefit and care systems that have been heavily underfunded through \"austerity\" politics we can turn to the work of China Mills (2018; Mills &amp; Pring, 2024) to see how the health system has a direct effect on the mental wellbeing and possibility of disabled life under these violent times, policies and politics. Here I will bring into focus my own embodied experiences of these relations, and how they made sense to me as a crip researcher.Here, I could talk for ages about the subtleties and changes in how my injected medicine is scheduled for delivery around the hard efficiencies of the system and not my capacities. Similarly I could turn to how Laura Forlano rubs up against and hacks her medical devices and relations (2023; 2016). I could discuss how I am a cyborg modified with biologics, and connected to a refrigerated delivery pipeline. How this has slowly changed without my input from a relation where the default was a call from a caring person, who would help to guide and talk through the process of arranging your delivery through to the current efficient appified model, that pings, pokes and \"reminds\" you to go through some fiddly forms, which you may not be in a good place to respond to. These sets of relations are complex and situated though, and some people may find this sort of automation frees them up to have more agency over their care, whereas others may find this system cannot care for their needs as it is too generalised.What I want to rub up against here is the neo-liberal catchy rhetoric around ethical automation. I heard the likes of \"a human in the system\" at a UKRI social science conferences, and which through a few words aims to cure the inabilities of automated systems to care. The irony is that there is always \"a person\" within a system if not many, some trying to approach it, some developing and orienting it, as well as the many maintaining it, but all of these positions and more seem to be ignored. By their definition they aim to cure the inabilities of the system by throwing another person in the middle, and this generalised five word slogan cannot specify where they are or what they are doing. You could throw in 100 more people, but if we do not care about how, where or what stuff they are doing, we could be doing them and the people, things and relations they are trying to \"care for\" as much damage as if they were not there. This next section gives a more precise encounter of automation without affirmation that I experienced in my chronic care. The lack of intimacy in this encounter highlights why the work of imagining and orienting towards affirmative infrastructure is so essential.In this section I will recount a recent experience of institutionalised \"care\" that left me with more violent damage to my body than it benefited my well-being. This began when I had my third major flare up of my life. This resulted mainly from being a crip person forced to work over full-time to financially survive when I only have the ability to work part-time. This relational fallout was due to unstable terms, non-existent support networks, both institutional and familial, and the invalidating exhaustive expectations of normative social roles. I have already touched on these causalities and eddies in earlier sections, so here I will orienting more around how in the aftermath of these relations, and when in search of care, it became a struggle to have my needs acknowledge let alone cared for. This reflection is also not meant as a individual tale of a singular crip's treatment, but a place to expand and fabulate from, especially in the UK. It is where I make room and time for us to imagine the industrial scales that the political/relations of institutional care tables operate through.When trying to reach out for help it first has to be noted that I was in the cracks of a system. I was between hospitals, not only due to having moved locations, but also due to me running away from similar mistreatment in my prior specialist department. This left me between pipelines of care and treading water to stay afloat as I flared up with no support beyond taking sick leave and time off of one of my four jobs I had at that time. When reaching out for a referral to my local hospital in Plymouth, both my GP and my previous carers both pointed the finger at each other to initiate this change. After a while I pushed the GP to initiate this move as I did want to get in touch or engage with my old department. They put me through as a standard referral, even though I was badly flared. After a month or two of \"self care\" I finally received a referral letter with no date on it, but telling me to check my contact details, ready for when they would contact me and a date would be given. I decided this was not good enough and pushed the GP to increase my urgency on the referral. In response he said that this was unlikely to do anything and tried to convince me not to do it. In response to this I told him that I was very much living in a reality where these things felt unlikely to change and I just needed him to try and see what would happen. After this strong defending of my needs he agreed to raise the importance of the referral. \"Against all the odds\" this resulted in me getting a call to book in an appointment one week later with my new specialist. In the virtual call with this specialist, he very calmly tried to quell my anxieties by offering me multiple examinations, from a low intrusive MRI, through to an intrusive colonoscopy, both to find out what the \"problem\" is. At the time this did comfort me somewhat but it became obvious that these were just words and none of the care would be non-intrusive.After this meeting I waited a few weeks, and eventually a letter came through the post of another non-dated referral for a colonoscopy. This time though it came with an enema kit, labelled, \"cleen, ready-to-use\" (+@fig:cleen). When I opened it up, I wondered how long, if ever, it would take for me to be given an appointment. The only thing I knew was that when the call came I had to empty my bowls ready for them to violate my body to acquire the data that would validate my pain, and the needs that I had already informed them of verbally.<br><img alt=\"Cleen and ready-to-use enema kit.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/cleen.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:cleen}A few weeks later, somewhat fortunately, and somewhat stressfully, I received another letter and call from the appointments team informing me that I had been given a slot in just under two weeks' time. Time shifted from an eternity into immediacy, taking me off balance as I was not prepared to experience the same treatment that had left me traumatised years before. The department's preparation for this appointment was again a virtual telephone appointment with a nurse to do the pre-assessment. In this call I tried to vouch for the type of care that I wanted, asking to be sedated as I knew this was a painful experience for me, and expressing that I had been previous difficulties with this procedure. In response the nurse only played down my fears and told me that it would not be as bad as I thought, and encouraged me not to be sedated for the procedure, and just to take gas and air to alleviate minor pain. I still tried to vouch for myself but ended up in a middle ground of trying gas and air, to then turn to sedation if I felt it was too much during the procedure. The thing I find extraordinary, beyond the playing down of my fears, is that when I expressed previous traumatic experiences in this area, they did not think to provide extra care for this, in the forms of providing sedation, nor mental health support going into it. They also did not ask for more information around what happened and how to care for it. Fortunately, I have the capacity to afford a private therapist that I have been seeing for a while and they squeezed me in last minute, and coached me through the upcoming treatment. It would have been very hard without this extra time and care. These extra times though were too much for the institutions of care to afford, and realistically had always been since the start of my disability 7 years prior. This denial of more time to care when we table sensitive bodies and relations in time is a denial and invalidation of the affirmative types of care that these institutions and their efficient capital configurations could hold if configured otherwise.When it came to the day of the procedure, I was lucky enough to have a support network that meant that it was possible for me to be sedated if I needed to be. If I was isolated, like many disabled people are, and without this support system of people to look after me for twenty four hours after the procedure, I would have had to forfeit sedation, as again the institution would not have the time to hold me. As I went in with my friend, we were early to be checked in, so hanging around awkwardly in the corridors of the hospital. When we finally went in to register me, I went to the desk of the department, where I was greeted by, as I guessed by their voice and demeanour, the nurse with whom I had had the phone pre-assessment. Again this interaction seemed to play down my fears and experiences, and pushed me to be squeezed and misfitted into the efficient configures slot of their normative care of gas and air and not be sedated as I had repeatedly asked. After this I waited with my friend, and after 30 minutes I was ushered into another pre-assessment room, where I was quantified, by weight, height and blood pressure, and then left to wait again but by myself.After sitting there for what felt like an eternity, with many thoughts running through my mind, and anxieties growing, I started to question and think about how to again try and advocate for the type of care that would affirm me here. I took small steps to test the waters and capacitiy for wiggle room within what felt like a very hard system. Initially I started by just asking to go to the toilet, which I had not been told where or if I could use. After this small success I had started to build up the momentum to feel like I was able to vouch for the type of care that I really needed. I was eventually taken through to the operating table, where I was briefly introduced to the two men operating on me who I had never met before, nor had a virtual call with. They went on to lay me down and prepare me for the operation, it's hard to remember but it initially felt like my desires to be sedated had not made it through. It was only when I stated the word \"traumatising\" in relation to my prior experiences that his eyes lit up, and he started to take me seriously. It is hard to say here whether that was in relation to providing me with the appropriate care for my situation, or whether it was that by stating these words I had gained leverage by holding him accountable to his actions.I still for some reason felt obliged to try and be shoehorned into the efficient slot of non-sedation, and have the sedation as a backup, something I will not do again. To prepare for this he went to put an IV in my left arm. After having my blood taken many times, every three months for the last 7 years, I am used to the pain and know what to expect, and also get complimented on how easy my veins are to find. As he slipped in, I felt more pain than normal, a sharp sting that I flinched at; as he tried to draw blood it worsened and so did my reaction. Disregarding my response and feelings and after a few more painful attempts to get it to flow he pulled out, telling me that I had not stayed in-line with his needle. I began to cry, feeling no trust in this person, or in how they were about to operate on me. I lay there still. Without a glance he moved to the other arm, and proceeded to try again. This time I was internally trying to stay in-line as much as possible as he slid inside of me. This time it felt the same as any other, and this time I did not flinch.This is also the time that I passed out, not that time at that table, but the time just after writing the last paragraph at this table. Twenty four hours later, writing this having again been treated by the NHS, this time for passing out, for falling from a counter chair, and for hitting my head on the ground. All because I dare to remember that time. I think it's safe to say that I will not be writing about that time, but I can tell you worlds collapsed, sedation through party drugs doubled by bodily violation and immense pain brought memories, spaces and feelings in-line and out of time. I blacked out from pain and I awoke still crying.Waking up on the floor after passing out remembering this, this time. I was assisted by the staff of the coffee shop. They helped me sit up, drink up and come to. They did, however, immediately get me to sign an accident waiver form to make sure that they would be covered around this individual \"problem\". They asked why it happened, I could not say. I texted my friend, and she said she was on her way. When I was doing better I gently walked home, around the corner, where she met me. I felt obliged by norms of rational care to call up 111, the low emergency support number in the UK. I felt okay, and had no clear signs of concussion, but the rationale of their care insisted I go back to the hospital, the same hospital I had remembered. They told me it was urgent, so I should pay for a taxi, but not important enough to send an ambulance, but they would be waiting and ready to receive me. I went in again, they did not know who I was and were not ready for me, sitting there like human livestock, watching people go mad around me in these sick times. I was quantified, I had my vitals taken after a few hours, but nothing said to me, just that it wouldn't be so bad. I waited another few hours with nothing said to me. I finally asked what was going on, they told me I had another 3-4 hours left to be seen. A senior doctor, not in the conversation and with his back to me looked over his shoulder said, \"you should probably go home\". I asked, \"do you know why I am here?\" He did not, even though I had told four people why I had passed out, because I had remembered. Their table of operations could not hold this information. They told me \"that I had decided to come here\", and so \"it was on me\". I told them \"111 had told me to be there\", so I felt like I had to go here, if it was up to me, I would have stayed home from the beginning. They didn't reply, I took a complaints number and left. I still haven't complained because I am not sure what it will do.As I woke up after the last time, crying, in came the \"specialist\" who had done this to me. He told me how my body was, he told me that I was having fast movements, when they were actually very slow, and told me to take medicine to slow me down further. I refused. He told me that I wasn't so inflamed, I told him it had been months since I was, so was starting to settle after my own care. He told me that when you focus on sensing something too much it can start to hurt more than if you ignore it. I had just stopped heavily dissociating from my body that year, and focusing on my body and feelings was helping me to get stable. He tried to get me to take more biological and immunosuppressant medicines as a quick fix. I refused and vouched for the type of care that I wanted: mental, dietary and financial. He looked confused. He then started to prescribe me dietary advice whilst I was still reeling in pain and confusion from this experience, not in a way where it was helpful, but in a way where he reinforced his expertise and role as a \"specialist\". He left, my friend picked me up, with another giving me a lift home.On my own Crip timeline of writing this thesis, it took me a month just to start writing again since being on the operating table, as I could not find the words. No one in those institutions and from that time called me up for aftercare. My bodymind was much worse off after being treated by them and it has taken many more than months to heal it still. These treatments, these performances of efficient industrial care and this experience have still not benefited me in any way so far, just left more scars on my bodymind. I again stepped out from this public institution and into private care, in the form of paying for myself to have a dietitian and try to improve things. This time, I think because I had paid for it, I had someone's time and this time they listened and cared. Over this time, I started to get better again.The \"specialist\" who had done this to me, had, however listened somewhat and gotten me a dietitian from the NHS. This appointment was more disorienting than helpful though. Even though I had been making progress, been gaining weight, been feeling better in my body, they told me that I should stop what I was doing and have a normal diet. That I should just be normal, otherwise I might be doing damage to my own bodymind, and that the feelings and practices I had grown in relation to my expertise where not okay. They didn't give me any advice on how to become \"normal\", just that I should be, and that I should also start eating things that I knew were painful to eat. They also told me I should get on more medication as a quick fix, even though I am not sure they were qualified to recommend this. Quite inappropriately they were also the one to tell me the results that came back from my operation, and that I was still inflamed, even though he had told me I wasn't when I awoke. This was over a month later and no one had reached out to tell me this before. They also told me I had a different condition to what I had been diagnosed with before. I left disenfranchised, disoriented and dissociating.I later had another appointment with my \"specialist\" as a follow up a month or two later than the dietitian. I arrived on time, the appointment was delayed. I waited an hour and a half. He finally made time for me. I went in, and he was already high energy, it was hard for me to orient around this anxious energy. I asked if I could record the meeting to listen back and chat about it with my sister. He said no and started saying I was trying to post him online, and set him up, I was not trying to do this. We ended up getting a nurse to help mediate the conversation. It carried on with this type of dynamic for the entire appointment, with him taking an hour to even \"remember\", acknowledge, and validate what happened in my last operation by him. Continually after this point he tried to make me feel bad for taking more time than my appointment allocated, of needing too much, and trying to shake me off this table. When we finally got past him acknowledging the operation happened we finally turned to future care for me, where he still told me I had a different condition to what I had been told all along. I contested this, but he said he knew, even though he did not have the files from my old hospital, as they had not been transferred. In a later meeting with my specialist nurse, which was actually the first close to affirmative appointment I had, she finally acknowledged that I had the condition I knew I had, and proven through the data my \"specialist\" had misread. She also noted that some of the medication that he had suggested would not have helped, was inappropriate and may have made things worse. The thing I found profound, and which is a sedimented critique of the medical model and pharma-capitol is his normalised move to prescribe very expensive, high side effect, and restraining medication, rather than provide social relational care for me. Instead of listening from the beginning where I asked for a dietitian, a therapist and some space to reorient my bodymind and which cost roughly the same if not less that the medication he wanted to prescribe, this \"data\" was invalidated, to instead go on a deep and violent exploration to the truth of the problem, which I already knew . . . was in the system.I don't recount this as a sympathy plea, as to say that I am the one suffering, or to recourse revenge on the problematic people in these systems, but to make room on this table for this stuff. Compared to other disabled people under the current economic system, I am a relatively financially stable person, and if you know me you know I am also very able and willing to defend my boundaries. I am also white and often perceived as a man by these institutions, which is frustrating, but all these things will orient the type of care I receive. This is one incident in my own life, and sits here as a frictious contour, a misfitting of needs, and a cliff to look over the bodily horizon of these institutions of care. It is to to make room to bring in the background of disability the norms of the institutions invalidate and ignore. Not as a matter of fact, but a fact that matters, and matters more when we fabulate to hold the many stories of people within this industrial grinding down of care. Ones which are much worse than this. Sitting in the A&amp;E for 5 hours was enough to see these lives, these times, and these bodyminds being driven mad and made sick in the presence of institutional care. This institution is not meant to hold all of these lives, experiences and pain, as it was never imagined to. This recollection of the operating table is here to wedge open the door from slamming shut and let these feelings spill through into dialogues of affirmative infrastructures. How can these Crip experiences, practices and wisdoms around institutions, around just refusal and self-advocacy, be in relation to those that wish to operate on us? How can they inform critiques of the current configurations of care and imagine the times, spaces and futures we really need? When I say really need, I mean really need.03.03_The_operating_tableHere is in many ways where I start to turn away from these other tables I have been institutionally forced to be in touch with and instead turn to the crip table that this research orients towards. This turning towards other crip tables is in many ways the retreat that I take throughout this research, and this inquiry aims to offer up reasons and sense making for why I have made room for the radically affirming crip politics in action. To do this I reflect on the times I have been inspired and my perspective shifted around what is not only possible, but what we could be orienting towards collectively through disability justice and collective access. This inquiry reflects on the simple ways I experienced M.E.L.T. centre rest and relaxation in their Rest Assured workshop with Sonic Acts. It also reflects on the ways that I felt guilty for the abundance of access and care that I experienced at Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' seminar Life Affirming Organisational Practices (Dhami, 2023). These experiences have informed the capacities I desire for the people around me, and myself when approaching the crip table. Much of this research has been an effort to put these life affirming relations I have been in touch with so briefly as the places I centre and orient from. This practice aims to overflow with abundance in my daily life and my organisational/institutional/infrastructural relations. This also stems from me, through this research, finally acknowledging my own disability, after 7 years, 3 flare ups, and many disabling social relations. After all this time, it is the radical relations this put into reach for me that made room for this work to feel at once acknowledged, validated and cared for, instead of having these practices, knowledges and labours backgrounded or hidden from view.<br><img alt=\"Visual for Rest Assured by M.E.L.T.\" src=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:melt}M.E.L.T.'s Rest Assured workshop was one of the first Crip encounters I had in my research, and life (knowingly). This was held as \"an online reading group on non-normative ways of experiencing, theorising, materialising, subverting and being in time\". This in action felt like a reading group of Crips coming together in the most tender and soft ways. Some of the things that touched me most were within the actions of care and time M.E.L.T. took to make the space so easily accessed by all members. This included things like access copiesof the upcoming presented/spoken text, which enabled us to follow along with the program and see what was coming ahead, so we could plan our capacities ourselves. It was also through the affective ways we felt in the space, how we were introduced to this reading group through a meditative relaxed listening of Kevin Gotkin's Artist in president talk (Kevin Gotkin 2021). The way we were also prompted to share mixtures of visual prompts and texts to represent how we felt, and what sort of capacities we had at that time. This group was made up of what they called 2.5 sessions. This was two full sessions, with more than 0.5 of room made for asynchronous interactions and exchanges. I had a mixture of things going on, from being tired, busy, anxious . . . I only made it to the first one. You could say that this made me miss out on knowing what happened within the workshop, but this specific very Crip position also oriented me to be able to know how this workshop was made knowable and flexible to these other temporalities and rhythms . The access copies they provided made room for me to catch up in my own time what had been going on within later sessions, and how they had approached and oriented these texts. Alongside this, and in between, was a shared Signal group chat where members shared excerpts of their lives and times that related to reading themes, as well as where we were in relation to them. Becoming in touch with these radical crip possibilities and practices of bringing people together in and out of sync, and through multiple points of contact, media, temporalities and approach really re-scoped my imagination of what collaboration and access could be practised as and made known through. It made me reconsider how I could structure, order and configure my relations, process and practices around a Crip time, interdependent care and critical access.Another key instance of coming into contact with radical Crip tables of access was that of Healing Justice London (HJL), Transformational Governance Collective and Beyond the Rules' day long seminar called Life Affirming Organisational Practices. These collectives held many different workshops and talks throughout the day, again through a combination of embodied practices, mixed media reflections, and collective dialogues. For me, even though I was by myself (and awkward and shy when so), this place was so welcoming, especially in comparison to the academic conferences I had experiences of. One moment that emphasised this to me was when I had booked a 1-2-1 with one of HJL's admin team to get advice on organising with In-grid, a collective I'm part of and inquire with later in this research. Even though they seemed slightly confused as to who I was, what In-grid as an organisation/collective did, and why I was talking to them, they still took time and care to advise me on how to organise with In-grid through radical care and life affirmation. Her feedback, and many of the messages of the day were fairly clear, and focused on making power known, and caring for the frictions and pains it holds, and in doing so make it transferable and transformable. Here she recommended we, as a very decentralised organisation, try to introduce a Raci matrix to map roles and responsibility, as well as doing skills audits to help with this. Through these practices, we can try to make accessible and knowable the skills and power within our community, so that we can collectively care for them, instead of individually controlling and reinforcing unwanted relations of power. This feedback is still very much in process within In-grid (as I think it will always be), but from this care-full recommendation we have started at least to structure and try to make room to figure out our flows of power in projects and make accountable our relations within them.<br>The Life Affirming Organisational Practices event also transformed my scoping of the possibility and promise of access. Compared to other academic institutional conferences I had participated in, there was so much care, thought and abundance when it came to access. This change in relations in many ways made me feel guilty for having been offered these modes of access. Where normal institutional conferences would charge a (large) fee, often not cover travel, and be just in person, this event gave grants for travel, admission fee waivers, and different modes of attending. Where academic conferences regulate and validate their grants, this event was offered without any need to validate your need of them. Unlike institutional systems I have mentioned in the computing table that force intimacy, table you and invalidate you, this group just gave if you asked, and trusted you. Reflecting on this feeling of guilt, it made me ask why was I feeling guilty here when I was finally having my needs met. I contemplated it might be that I had not filled in any forms, so I was unsure if I was valid or not, but dismissed this. I realised for me, in many ways it aligns with a guilt proposed by Audre Lorde<a data-footref=\"25\" href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-1-dfd1e7b6ef976c20_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where it is a guilt of inaction, both from myself, but also from those around me and from the institutions that hold these ableist inaccessible relations in place. When in touch with such radical care, access and affirmation it informs us not only what we have not been doing or vouching for ourselves, but also as teachers, collaborators and organisers, what we have not been doing for others. Moving on from this feeling and sense making of guilt and into the joys of actioning its sense I have been building up my own capacities for understanding, navigating and caring for access in ways informed by being in touch and at these care-full crip tables.The final thing I want to touch upon at this table and that has informed my approach to this research and collaborations, is some of the practices and concepts shared in HJL's Why Somatics? Growing the Embodied Capacity for Transformational Governance workshop. During this very embodied workshop, they surfaced an understanding and approach to practising life affirming infrastructures and institutes, stating that \"broken people coming together will only ever make more broken systems\". This does not reproducethe preconception that we can cure these people or systems, but suggests that to move towards an affirming one, we need to first heal ourselves, to then care for those around us through these systems and infrastructures. It also helps me ask, how do I ally? What do they need? Then, from this orientation, I can start to care for the relations of these institutions, infrastructures and the politics they want to configure. <br>\"Guilt is not a response to anger; it is a response to one's own actions or lack of action. If it leads to change then it can be useful, since it is then no longer guilt but the beginning of knowledge.\" - (Lorde, 1997, p.&nbsp;282)<a href=\"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-1-dfd1e7b6ef976c20_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n03.04_The_crip_tableThis research in many ways orients a certain dance between these separate, but overlapping institutional tables. In many ways this is framed as a retreat in this work, of trying to put the violences of certain tables out of reach, and orient them towards notions, politics and practices of radical crip life affirmation. In this retreat though, and through a Crip understanding of the cyborg, we are still attached to and entangled with them. Through being in relation with these institutional tables of computing, academia and care, I can also shape them in return. It is this refusal to stay in line and to give feedback where it is not wanted. It is when I come to the operating table and finally talking back to the \"expertise\" of my \"specialist\", not only to refuse medicine and advice that will harm me, but also asking if he had ever read any disability studies? When he said no, I said, \"Don't you think it is interesting you have never listened to the people you care for?\" It is when I come to the computing table and the student account interface and feel the normative urge to police them for their attendance, to instead ask myself, \"How do I care for this person and to be an ally in their building of capacities?\" It is now that I have my own capacity to sit at research tables and send emails telling people what my needs are, and defining good boundaries around them. It is me writing this research and making wiggle room for these reflections and inquiries that maybe give too much information, emotion and anger, but offer within that the capacity to hold these necessary points and times out of line so to disorient and manifest this work from.In this dance I make many mistakes, I am clumsy, I am mad, I am Crip. In this dance I take just a few steps, a couple back, a number sideways. In this dance and between these tables, as I get to grips with them, as they try to shake me off, and as I try to hold on, I build my capacity to reorient them. The shaping effect that some have on me I also have on others, and it is within these frictions, flows, rhythms and moves that this research starts to manifest itself. Again, not through one point but a repetitive Crip-Tic and recursive practice of wiggling room within, between and around the capacities of these hard systems and institutes for our communities and their many tables to be cozily in relation.03.05_Dancing_with_tables04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes","level":1,"id":"03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas\" href=\"03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Configuration</a>","level":1,"id":"[Configuration](03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas)_0"},{"heading":"Entries","level":1,"id":"Entries_0"},{"heading":"03.01_The_research_table","level":1,"id":"03.01_The_research_table_0"},{"heading":"The research table","level":2,"id":"The_research_table_0"},{"heading":"03.02_The_computing_table","level":1,"id":"03.02_The_computing_table_0"},{"heading":"The computing table","level":2,"id":"The_computing_table_0"},{"heading":"03.03_The_operating_table","level":1,"id":"03.03_The_operating_table_0"},{"heading":"The operating table","level":2,"id":"The_operating_table_0"},{"heading":"03.04_The_crip_table","level":1,"id":"03.04_The_crip_table_0"},{"heading":"The crip table","level":2,"id":"The_crip_table_0"},{"heading":"03.05_Dancing_with_tables","level":1,"id":"03.05_Dancing_with_tables_0"},{"heading":"Dancing with tables","level":2,"id":"Dancing_with_tables_0"},{"heading":"<a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas\" href=\"Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas</a>","level":1,"id":"[04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas](Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas.canvas)_0"}],"links":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-1-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-2-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-3-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-4-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-1-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-2-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-3-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-4-a709b0bc6cf00e6f_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fn-1-dfd1e7b6ef976c20_0","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html#fnref-1-dfd1e7b6ef976c20_0","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.00_intro.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.01_the_research_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.02_the_computing_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.03_the_operating_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.04_the_crip_table.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/03.05_dancing_with_tables.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_entries/pandoc_order.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/s4_360.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/cleen.html","03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_media/rest-assured.html"],"createdTime":1756048612766,"modifiedTime":1756048612766,"sourceSize":3515,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_Crip-Tic_of_vignettes_canvas.canvas","exportPath":"03_crip-tic_of_vignettes/03_crip-tic_of_vignettes_canvas.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"canvas"},"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.00_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html":{"title":"04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles","icon":"","description":"This chapter follows on from the framing of the last two chapters to discuss how I have formed a methodology for this research project. The methodology I have taken up is a situated implementation of disobedient action research. This disobedience and its foundations of action research follows the many crip and queer figures that were called on in the last chapter, and especially within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, where it demands to step out of line, to find other routes that institutional inflexibilities do not have the capacity for and to defiantly take those actions now.In this move to shake off the the academic table of methods that holds us in-line, I turned to action research as a place to empower the position of practitioners (in this case collaborators and I) as a knowledge creators. This methodology approaches these experiences by giving depth and insight to relations where an embodied framing makes room for it to be understood in action, from a situated perspective and knowledge. I then move to orient this methodology through first person action research, where I bring in the background of my research and to make room within it for a situated embodiment of these inquiries. From this position and that of my crip framing, I felt this research necessitates a disobedient approach, one that manifests a disorientation of the scope and norms of the actions within action research. It poses this work to take on direct actions together right now! Of refusing to be a part of, assimilate to and be quiet about certain politics and their violent relations!After this setting up of a disobedient action research methodology I go on to discuss how I have taken up this methodology in three (ish) cycles of action and reflection, and how they have been approached at different intersections of social and technical infrastructures within and around institutions.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disobedient Action Research Cycles","level":1,"id":"Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.00_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612788,"modifiedTime":1756048612790,"sourceSize":2048,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_entries/04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md","exportPath":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.00_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html":{"title":"04.01.00_Action-research","icon":"","description":"This section brings into focus why this research has oriented towards action research as a methodology.

To trace these crossing lines I am working with Judi Marshall's notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty and Marshall 2021; Marshall 1999) and Living Systemic Thinking (Marshall 2004) that make room for me to not only take on the calls for action I have made in the previous chapter but also to bring into those actions the necessary reflection that quality inquiry and research entails<a data-footref=\"31\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html#fn-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.Marshall's LLI (1999; 2004; Gearty and Marshall 2021) work is a specific type of action research named first person action research, which is where the first intersection crosses paths with my proposed framework. In first person action research Marshall is in many ways practicing a methodology that makes room for the background of the practitioner to settle in, like Ahmed (2006), and brings in the context, relations and feelings of the person making the research. In her essay Living Life as Inquiry -- a Systemic Practice for Change Agents (2021) with Margaret Rose Gearty, which acts as a 20 year celebration and retrospective since the paper and method was first published and to examine how LLI has been taken up in many orientations. There are a number of focuses in this essay on how Living Life as Inquiry can be practised but there is a key focus on how it makes room for an embodiment of research. Marshall phrases it as \"Inquiry has woven itself into my life\" (2021, 454). This embodiment and weaving of research into life is key for my practice as it makes room for me to wiggle into this research, my experiences of being crip and queer within and around institutional limits and their relations. It let's me situate this research to my context, to think through what it means for me as a middle class 'white', crip and queer researcher, with chronic illness, pain and fatigue to be approaching deeply neo-liberal and efficiency driven institutions in the UK. This embodiment of research also enables me to think about how these positions of practice and of making embodied actions is itself a space of knowledge generation, and one that finds the capture or determination of these knowledges impossible in many ways. In Living Systemic Thinking (2004) Marshall gives the example of her colleagues and her reflecting on a review process of a student, to a fine grain of reflection, and shows how each person interprets these relations differently. She approaches this not to de-validate the difference and nuance but to work with these varied perspectives as other orientations of an issue, that form their own understandings of these actions and their relations to them (ibid, 15). Marshall's position on the embodiment of research also offers me to bring feelings and affect into practice, intersecting with a crip focus on affectivity. This navigation of embodiment informs my orientation of actions and their deliberation to not be led by but to account for how it has felt within the relations, how what is expected causes friction or how what I desire to undertake brings joy.<br>With this engagement of self, of bringing feelings into action, and those actions into inquiry and knowing they pose another way of orienting myself. Marshall and Gearty through their approach to LLI also ask of me to think about how I direct or orient myself, much like I discussed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a> section through the work of Ahmed. With LLI they think through how these practitioner and actioned knowledges that I practice, can in themselves form alternative orientations to those of hegemony and institutions. In an essay called Living Systemic Thinking (ibid) Marshall terms it as \"sense making\", and later on her and Gearty ask us to work with this sensing think through \"when to persist or desist\" (2021, 457) in direction. With this they present Living Life as Inquiry as a method to process what to inquire into and how to orient relational actions towards that outcome. To do this in this embodied context they work with a few notions to consider how to feel out what is appropriate to be done in that context. They talk about \"staying fresh and open\" (ibid, 455), where by taking life into inquiry, we question our habits, our sedimented patterns and norms to think through and feel out other approaches and paths to the outcome. To do this they propose \"checking for signs of vitality\" (ibid, 455) as a way to do pulse-checks, to ask \"How am I, here and now?\", and to balance between inquiring mindlessly forward and being stuck within the fine grain and frozen. They also pose these pulse-checks to be embodied and not always consciously reasoned to aim to unravel the notion of \"pursuit\" within research. This is where I can move away from a determined end goal or sedimented straight path and tending towards feeling out dynamic and emerging research to decide the next actions to make. They also bring up the notion of \"working with emotions\"( ibid, 456) as a way to inquire into \"what is really important\", of connecting to the issue on an embodied level and letting these feelings not determine but be engaged in what I feel I need to tend to.This leads onto their proposition of \"practices of discernment\" (ibid, 457), which interestingly isn't about where to act but more about when. As they note it can be about discerning when to be \"waiting things out\" and when to be working out \"what is what\" before deciding how to act, positioning Marshall's notion on \"when to persist or desist\" within time. Practising this within Ahmed's framing of inherited and sedimented relations makes room for me to think, where am I now, and what can I change within my reach. In a textural response to this notion Marshall and Gearty give the image of the Heron/yoga pose, of one leg in the water, of feeling the ripples and many forms of data lap against your body and to patiently discern what they mean and what/when to action. They follow this texture with their notion of \"the timely move to action\" (ibid, 458), which continues to ask how and when to take actions of inquiry but also where. In this embodied methodology they prompt us to think through where this can be in the relations we are entangled into, which can be an internal action on the self, or an \"inward action\" as they term it. In doing this though they don't divide between what they call the inward and outward arcs of action, but instead see them as performances of an entangled process. This prompts this research to re-scope where the actions of action research can be taken when embodied in research, and has pushed me as a practitioner to inquire into how I am internally orienting practices and how this is affected by and affecting outward actions.Following on from (but also maybe before/during) is their conception of reflection of action. Why I say maybe before/during is due to the troubling of the separation of action and reflection that LLI encourages. Instead with LLI Marshall and Gearty ask me to be open to the complex ways that these movements of action and reflection are entwined and interdependent, with reflection being in many ways an action in itself. Within this dialogue of reflection in mind they form another few notions to think with and help reflect on what matters within and around our actions. They ask us to revisit the \"inner and outer arcs of attention\" (ibid, 458), and that by taking time with both the internal embodied and external actions each will inform and develop the understanding of one another. Somewhat intersecting with crip theory they compare the entanglement of these arcs to that of the bodymind, and its move to dissolve the boundary between the two, where action and reflection move as one muscle. This is also closely read into in Living Systemic Thinking (2004) where Marshall takes up a close reading and reflection of their approach at each stage in line with feedback from colleagues to deliver a quality emerging inquiry into institutional processes through her enactment and relation to them.Returning to LLI they also work with the notion of \"the processual nature of inquiry\" (ibid, 459) that prompts us to approach these cycles of sense-making as ways to move beyond the determined and inherited generalised models of research and instead situate these orientating processes within the embodied practices of the researcher. In these modes of orienting they pose knowledge as ephemeral and fleeting as it sits within the relation of action and practice. They open to reflection that does not model, generalise and predetermine moments but evoke practice that makes room for me to visit the relations I engage in afresh to rethink the sedimented paths we take towards them. In this move and throughout the paper they also open up to what they call textures, such as the Heron description above, which takes the form of images, figures and reflections that act as experiments of how to express these feelings, practices and enquires where words may fail us. This orientation of modes of reflection within Action Research intersects well with a crip position, and one which I relate to a lot, where words can escape me. Here they make room for these discursive knowledges through embodied technical and social practices to be validated as generative ways of getting to know the relational \"problems\" at hand through other revealing practices. How drawing, metaphoring and coding can be ways to reflect and key modes of action, inquiry and sense-making. The last notion they leave us with is that of \"reviewing generative/degenerative aspects of inquiry\" (2021, 459), and is a very kind one that in many ways echo's that of pulse-checking. With this notion they discuss the balance you have to take in first-person inquiry to not get caught in self-critical cycles, which can stop actions from taking place and trap researchers inward. To manage this line they say to monitor what is being looked at, with degenerative inquiry being characterised by \"over-rumination or joylessness\". Here again aligning with a crip move to imagine disalignment as a generative site, and one where there is always a possibility of joy and pleasure. This is again where in places within myself and in relation to others, we can inquire into how these sites of friction as not invalidated and determined actions of humiliation, pain and duress, but how they make room for the possibility to be joyous and pleasurable places of inquiry.Bringing LLI into action in this research has empowered me undertaking it in a number of ways. It has made room for me to unfold and situate the research within my manys contexts and practices as a crip and queer researcher throughout the PhD. It has also prompted me to engage my feelings, bodily relations and emotions into an embodied research practice. It has given space to the technical and social practices I undertake, of thinking through code, finding frictions in coalition and of trying to survive within and around these institutions, as generative and informative textures of this research. It has also buffered these crip and queer notions of finding our own paths together, and that those are ones we desire, find vital and map to our bodies. In retrospect first person inquiry has given my research practice the capacity to change paths. For example a key turning point in this research is that through quality inquiry I decided to desist working with and for certain logics of automation and organisation that invoke and determine dominative centralised control and come from violent ableist and eugenics histories. Instead to step back, reorient and persist at the practice of social infrastructure that inform how to decentralise and disorient their technical counterpart through community interdependence and critical access.In this move to desist to then persist I found though that there were some crip frictions I have with this framing of LLI and Action Research here. Even though they counter narratives of pursuit and make rooms for finding my own way through embodied practices, their focus can be somewhat be Cripped more in relation to instituional processes. When Marshall references Meyerson and Scully's concept of \"tempered radicals\" (1999, 3) it is hard to imagine crip theory so normalised, subdued and conformed. Of course we get \"heated up and cooled down\" when \"being simultaneously outsider and insider\" of institutions, but it is not about getting \"tougher\". I know that in my inquiry I have moved, sometimes without reason from being tempered, to flexible, to brittle, to wet, to rusted, to loose and to tempered again. This isn't to say this divergence isn't possible within First Person AR, but the Crip orientation I desire aims to move beyond the need to be tempered towards institutional norms and our manifestings, as being tempered may make unlivable the many approaches to a crip notion of justice and radical access before they even begin. This is not to say being tempered and playing the valid role of \"user\" or \"expert\" to subvert or hack, or to reflect on the ways we emerge in relation to institutions are not valid in this critique. It is instead to disorient this table of action and to make known-able through critical access, the labours and their knowledges that these institutions invalidate. In relation to my experiences from and orientation to institutions and their imaginary possibility for these radical politics and social relations we call for is that they are limited through very restrictive terms that collectively in my collaborations, we can only form small amounts of wiggle room within and around. To find the space and relations that I desire and that can start to make room for these sorts of imaginary practices I turned disobediently from methods where I have to be tempered, and I have disoriented this through crip theory, interdependence and of movement making. This isn't to neglect the change I can and have made in the institution, but it is to pivot from crip futures they cannot hold. It is to make time and room to feel out my orientation towards these more restrictive and sedimented organisational practices of institutions, and figure out how to counter them. <br>\"quality (a term I prefer to 'validity')\" (Marshall, 2004, p. 3)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html#fnref-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Action research","level":2,"id":"Action_research_0"}],"links":[".html","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html#fn-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0",".html","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html#fnref-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612790,"modifiedTime":1756048612791,"sourceSize":14832,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_Action-research.md","exportPath":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.01.00_action-research.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.02.00_why-not-other_action-research.html":{"title":"04.02.00_Why-not-other_Action-Research","icon":"","description":"It is of course sensible to ask, and for me to reason why I have decided on First Person Action Research instead of other modes of AR.

With this work she focuses on the notion of participatory to surface the ways that disabled interdependence is what has made her research happen. She also reflects on these exchanges in a very embodied, vulnerable and situated approach that a Crip studies approach encourages. This embodied mode being one that also crosses heavily into First Person Action Research. In my research I have similarly manifested it through these Crip support networks, through interdependence and from community, and I definitely do not want to underplay their participation in this work. I do though chose to orient towards First Person Action Research as I want to focus not so much on disabled people participating in the institutional norms or within disabled exclusive space, but instead towards how crip people as active change makers can transform the more intersectional organisations, institutions and systems around us.

It provides us with inscriptions, de-scriptions and re-in-terpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along.\" (Rocha and Snelting 2017, 45)This is the point when this first person action research becomes a disobedient form of Action Research. This is because it makes room for these practices to move away from and refuse the institutional and hegemonic norms that a crip orientation of justice also refuses. Much like the disobedient demand of the Crip Technoscience Manifesto which I work with, and moves to access through friction (Hamraie and Fritsch 2019, 10), disobedient action poses us to take direct actions now! It aims to form futures within and around institutes that can't hold them yet, and defiantly practice politics that they are not ready to imagine. In the essay 'We Have Always Been Geohackers' (2021) by Helen Pritchard, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting, they position the methodology of Disobedient Action Research as a means to re-scope and re-think how we practice questioning, maintaining and developing sociotechnical systems and infrastructures. As they pose it through this essay, what does it mean to debug a system in the context of computing, its institutions and politics that hold it in place. In the contexts and configurations of their interventions, they ask how normative/obedient debugging in open source communities often reinforces systems instead of questioning and transforming them. Through their analysis they focus on how breaking up the \"hardest problems\" into \"tiny\" and \"squeezable\" bugs can limit what can be said and done. This question can also be easily applied through crip studies, where we could ask how does fitting into and assimilating to the institution's \"squeezable\" terms of access actually limit the contingent possibilities of change we could make otherwise?In their essay they take up the debugging of Gplates, a free software tool and web-portal for tectonic plate modelling and mineral prediction for extraction. This debugging took place in a collective workshop where a group of non-technocrats, nor technical specialists produced their own independent knowledge, expertise and critiques of how these systems figure tectonic movements and their volumetric predictions of mineral resources. Through these non-hegemonic counter figures, the group questioned the naturalised aesthetics and navigational tools of Gplates. This includes questioning the representations of the globe's default as a blank grey orb awaiting to be projected on us by the god like viewer (+@fig:grey), reinforced through to the time slider that lets you smoothly slide through \"mega-annums of geological time\" (ibid, 250). In questioning the software through these actions and reflections, they open up conversations of what agencies does the earth, and those bodies living on it have (ibid, 252-53). When a software has tool names orientating \"grabbing\", especially around land, minerals and bodies, what semantics, meaning and use does this inscribe (ibid, 252).<img alt=\"Figure from the We have always been Gephackers chapter, which they caption &quot;Gplates interface before loading geodata (grey earth)&quot;\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/gplates_interface.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:grey}<br>Bringing these insights back to their critique of debugging. In this emerging practises that don't try to\"isolate\" these huge and complex issues so that they are squeezable within hegemonic logics of debugging. Instead try to feel out and validate situated, nuanced and ephemeral critiques that can't be reproducible for a developer or for a rigorous study. This is where they encourage me<a data-footref=\"q2\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> to be disobedient to these norms and instead of scaling down bugs, try to practice them across scales of time and space, displacing and intersecting the iterations and versions across software development.<br>Much like Ahmed's relating to lesbian roles of butch-femme as performances and not determined roles that I cover in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.02_Queering_the_axis.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.02_Queering_the_axis</a>, being disobedient doesn't aim to reject or discredit fields of expertise, practices, scales and knowledges that it works with but to trouble their performances and problematize their aftermath. This orients these disobedient actions, so I aim to feel their frictions and to question how technical systems are imagined, executed and orientated, moving to figure out how I (and others) can imagine and practise with them otherwise. Intersecting here with a crip set of political/relational scales, this refuses access and equality through assimilation or prescribed terms, but instead makes room to locally image sets of demands and actions to make. Here I reflect to Collin Kennedy, who is mentioned in the Crip Techniscience Manifesto, and I touched upon earlier in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>,. His refusal to pay to park, and access his care is radically out of the bugs an access form is imagined to hold, but also questions time, relational access, and capitalised care.<br>The Gplates debugging in We Have Always Been Geohackers (ibid) is only one of a number that they have taken on. These later impositions through their organisation The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest (TITiPI) and with many collaborators. Through these instances they are practising disobedience to the norms of big tech's expansive and violent development. They inquire into how they can gain purchase and get to grips with what they have capacity to change through challenging the sedimentations of norms and taking direct action to re-orient them now. Other examples of these intersections take place on github where through these disobedient terms of action research they enthusiastically are \"always-already entangled\"(Barad 2007). With \"The long tail of contact tracing\"(Aouragh, Pritchard, and Snelting 2020b; 2020a) they pose some of these \"Hardest Problems\" to contact tracing technologies during the Covid pandemic and their norms towards surveillance methods and discrimination on the DP-3T (Decentralised Privacy - Preserving Proximity Tracing ) documents repository. In the DP-3T repo<a data-footref=\"q3\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-2-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, as a place already somewhat critical of the hegemonic centralised norms of other contact tracing algorithms, welcomed these critiques and conversations, and these direct provocations evoked dialogue within that development community. Other repos did not respond in a similar way.<br>In EU Digital COVID Certificates: When governments move fast and break things (Aouragh et al. 2021b; 2021a) a critique of the EU DCC (Digital Covid Certificate), this was not the same case. Their commentary in the issue post/bug report was that a new idtoken which tracks each person's COVID status and (dis/en)ables them travel and move, as being something that we should be very cautious of. This is especially the case when there are no safeguards around who can read and use the data stored in the QR codes. This is also doubled by the fact that many of the medical infrastructures in Europe are not fully digitised, and this approach enforces them to \"scale up\" these specific digital surveillance systems immediately to comply. They point out that such quick move to restrictive measures through digital surveillance infrastructures will undoubtedly hit many issues, which in these cases will deeply affect the lives of people \"cared\" for by these systems. Here the disobedient debugging was not met by the same sort of reception as on the DP-3T post, but instead was within a day commented on<a data-footref=\"q4\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-3-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> to say it was in the wrong section (a technical forum) for this type of discussion. As in it was not a squeezable bug they would accept. It was then immediately closed and moved to a limited discussion for just private collaborators of the repo.Another example of disobedience from them is in their bug report of Frontier Climate (Aouragh et al. [2017] 2024a; [2017] 2024b) where they critique Big Techs selling of carbon credits and offset as a means to not reduce, but expand carbon exploration and dependency. This debugging showed a different face than the rest, as Frontier totally deleted the post. This move to delete, instead of the normative sideline, close down and avoid, shows the power of these comments and their direct actions to that company. It shows how these critiques if tabled could potentially reorient things, so have to be thrown off.<br>These disobedient intersections not only, as said in Pritchard's talk at 4S*EASST (2024), \"give feedback where it is not always wanted\", but in this direct action of giving feedback to them publicly it shows us how receptive these organisations and projects are to scaled up bugs. In their response we can publicly note if they listen and join the discussion. In this we can also feel them wriggle as they (not so) subtly restrict the bug to a side room away from discourse. When they give this feedback and try to get to grips with these scaled up buds, it is easy to know when they pull away, and into retreat as they delete the commentary from existence. In these disobedient actions they force the hand of the repository/software maintainer to not only engage with political commentary and critiques, but to also position themselves in relation to it publicly. Do they engage, avoid or squeeze these bugs however possible? are they too big for them to manage and so they avoid or do they feel their hold so delete them out of existence? Here I am thinking of disobedience as a practice to change how dynamics are performed to show relations, people and bodies under another spectrum, and to figure out what roles they perform when taken off script. Reflecting back to <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, these practices align with those of access as friction, and that of the \"non-compliant user\", wiggling room for dialogues where they have been silenced.Another key part of this \"giving feedback where it is not always wanted\" is that of making room for and building up this feedback that is not wanted. It is about collectively telling other stories of technologies, infrastructures and policies, than the rhetoric of their management. Here we can turn to TITiPI and friends work on infrables (2022), where they present methods for building up bugs from embodied and experienced relations of infrastructure. These methods not only build from those of first-person action research but also follow on from a crip orienting from the sites of impact of infrastructure and politics to inform the change needed. The work of infrables takes these processes on by developing a collaborative workshop and practice to unfold these other stories of Big Tech infrastructures. In this workshop practising ways to perform and transform anecdotes of infrastructures and their institutions into fables that can challenge those of mainstream and dominant narratives. Bringing this into crip centred methods, I turn to the work of Nat Decker and Cielo Saucedo's Cripping_Computer_Graphics (2023). Here they similarly offer up how cripping as method makes wiggle room for crip bodies within 3D environments, as well as wider relations and norms of computation institutions. Here taking up Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of \"cripping\" (2003, 37) as method to make room to feel the disorientations of crip bodies in relations to the norms of these technologies. Here they question how the diversity and many intersections of crip bodies disorient the normalised forms and mechanics of computer graphics, from the avatars to the ways they are rigged, and even how these virtual bodies are licensed and sold. Here they again make room for their crip expertise to question the sedimented bodies and limits of these systems.As I shared in the last two chapters the dominant terms are ones of silencing disabled and frictious voices to keep the narrative straight and to rule out any queries. By making room to tell these counter stories, and disobediently performing them as fables, this work aims to disorient how infrastructures and their aftermaths are felt and understood through centring the expertise and knowledges of the communities they are in touch with. These impact centred method are where I bring in these embodied elements of action research, of working with crip practitioner knowledge to animate the lines that are drawn and what is naturalised and sedimented as the norm. <br>\"We need a cross-platform, intersoftware, intracommunity, transgenealogical way of reporting that, instead of making bugs smaller, scales them up in time and space and that can merge untested displacements and intersections into its versioning ladder.\"(Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021, 250)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Repo or repository, is a place for storing code, files and resources, which is organised through a varying set of version control and management protocols that enable the owner to manage a stable up to date version of its content.<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-2-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"As this is not a technical issue with the specification, I will move this to the discussion forum.\"(Aouragh et al. 2021a)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-3-8276dfb46d8cd231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Disobedient action research","level":2,"id":"Disobedient_action_research_0"}],"links":["04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0",".html",".html","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-2-8276dfb46d8cd231_0","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fn-3-8276dfb46d8cd231_0",".html","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-1-8276dfb46d8cd231_0","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-2-8276dfb46d8cd231_0","04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html#fnref-3-8276dfb46d8cd231_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/gplates_interface.html"],"createdTime":1756048612791,"modifiedTime":1756048612791,"sourceSize":13620,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_Disobedient-action-research.md","exportPath":"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.00_disobedient-action-research.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.03.01_bringing-disobedience_into_action.html":{"title":"04.03.01_Bringing Disobedience_Into_Action","icon":"","description":"When it comes to bringing these disobedient methods into my Action Research, I am informed by TITiPI's questioning of the roles and relations we play when debugging systems.

This disobedience intersecting with the crip cyborg (Kafer 2013), and the health rebel (Kafer 2017), engaging with and stepping out of line from the violent norms of computational systems and institutional logics. In doing this I am also turning to see how these practices of forming counter narratives, figures and manifestings of sociotechnical fables can be brought into action in the making of collective infrastructures. Asking how can my collaborators and I imagine other ways of relating with these technologies in retreat from their violent origins and contemporary uses and towards manifesting our own imaginaries and politics around them.With a queer disobedience I also take actions through transdisciplinary approaches which echo Ahmed's wiggle room (2014) loosening of determined roles to performances. In this wiggling making room with this disobedience for the roles and discipline within research, forming queer lines between them.

I have though found it helpful to map these arcs into three movements, which are themselves covered by each of the following three chapters. These stages overlap and have greatly informed one another, as well as many happenings that do not quite fit into this thesis, but I found this approach helpful to orient these movements more accessibly.

In my practice of ethics I have also queried these norms of the institutional forms of ethics, both in the ways they navigate ethics, but also how they template it for me to fill in. In this research this had been enacted by doing more traditional ethics forms for the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a> and the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> focus groups I have taken on, making sure they know what the research is, sign to consent, and have the ability to remove consent. In following these norms of course I have found friction along my Crip axis. One of places I have found friction is with the mandatory use of both ZOOM and Outlook, as being the ethical secure spaces for this research. This is because they are able to \"stably\" provide a service which fits to the tick-box regulations of GDPR, even with their fluctuating terms (Rob Pegoraro, 2023), and in doing so secure the stability of institutional contracts. Why I find friction is that Big tech models and tick-box economies that this research is trying to wiggle around, and so being forced to use them seems slightly unethical, and undermining. The unethical aspect also accentuated by the scales of these cloud economies, of the politics these infrastructures enforce when you use them, and the inability to orient otherwise in the inflexible hard systems. This was particularly true when it came to how to document my working together with others, both in workshops and focus groups. Here instead of orienting towards these infrastructures which in many ways reinforce research as surveillance, where we document exact words in time, hold people to them and orient arguments from them, I disoriented to forming collective notes, of taking time to care for what people wanted to say and to manifesting an inquiry together. This move for me not only ethically changes how we engage with the communities we work with and the infrastructures we meet them with, retreating from surveillance norms, but also as a researcher with fatigue it has reduced my labour hugely. This reduction in labour also making the research itself more ethical for me to take, and also opening up critique around what we might have capacity for in research, if we are not trying to hold these people and their words in place. It also orients to the critique that runs throughout this research, that representation and assimilation in sedimented technologies and their naturalised ethics isn't always that ethical, and we can find other disobedient ways to disorient these relations to our own crip and queer axes, desires and needs.This retreat from a particular type of individualised practise of research and ethics is highlighted in the way I have been undertaking my First Person Action Research. Here much like Marshall (Marshall, 2004), I have initiated focus groups with those I have inquired into working with. These have been enacted through a-synchronous collective reflections, based through my drafted inquiries and signal chat (groups), and where I invited feedback from others and room for them to add their own perspective. Orienting towards this direction has brought much joy into this research, as I reflect back with collaborators and companions on our times together, of how it has emerged into compounding reflections and unfolding actions. This felt quite vulnerable for me to do, and I definitely delayed and anxiously avoided it for a while, but it has also added much more depth to my research and made room for me reconsider my normalised and sedimented paths toward these inquiries.

04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles_canvas04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_CyclesThis chapter follows on from the framing of the last two chapters to discuss how I have formed a methodology for this research project. The methodology I have taken up is a situated implementation of disobedient action research. This disobedience and its foundations of action research follows the many crip and queer figures that were called on in the last chapter, and especially within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, where it demands to step out of line, to find other routes that institutional inflexibilities do not have the capacity for and to defiantly take those actions now.In this move to shake off the the academic table of methods that holds us in-line, I turned to action research as a place to empower the position of practitioners (in this case collaborators and I) as a knowledge creators. This methodology approaches these experiences by giving depth and insight to relations where an embodied framing makes room for it to be understood in action, from a situated perspective and knowledge. I then move to orient this methodology through first person action research, where I bring in the background of my research and to make room within it for a situated embodiment of these inquiries. From this position and that of my crip framing, I felt this research necessitates a disobedient approach, one that manifests a disorientation of the scope and norms of the actions within action research. It poses this work to take on direct actions together right now! Of refusing to be a part of, assimilate to and be quiet about certain politics and their violent relations!After this setting up of a disobedient action research methodology I go on to discuss how I have taken up this methodology in three (ish) cycles of action and reflection, and how they have been approached at different intersections of social and technical infrastructures within and around institutions.\n04.01.00_Action-research<br>This section brings into focus why this research has oriented towards action research as a methodology. Following on from the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> chapter and its framing of embodied and relational politics I have found that action research aligns and intersects at a number of places that are key. To trace these crossing lines I am working with Judi Marshall's notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty and Marshall 2021; Marshall 1999) and Living Systemic Thinking (Marshall 2004) that make room for me to not only take on the calls for action I have made in the previous chapter but also to bring into those actions the necessary reflection that quality inquiry and research entails<a data-footref=\"31\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-1-6710f3169dcd68ce_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.Marshall's LLI (1999; 2004; Gearty and Marshall 2021) work is a specific type of action research named first person action research, which is where the first intersection crosses paths with my proposed framework. In first person action research Marshall is in many ways practicing a methodology that makes room for the background of the practitioner to settle in, like Ahmed (2006), and brings in the context, relations and feelings of the person making the research. In her essay Living Life as Inquiry -- a Systemic Practice for Change Agents (2021) with Margaret Rose Gearty, which acts as a 20 year celebration and retrospective since the paper and method was first published and to examine how LLI has been taken up in many orientations. There are a number of focuses in this essay on how Living Life as Inquiry can be practised but there is a key focus on how it makes room for an embodiment of research. Marshall phrases it as \"Inquiry has woven itself into my life\" (2021, 454). This embodiment and weaving of research into life is key for my practice as it makes room for me to wiggle into this research, my experiences of being crip and queer within and around institutional limits and their relations. It let's me situate this research to my context, to think through what it means for me as a middle class 'white', crip and queer researcher, with chronic illness, pain and fatigue to be approaching deeply neo-liberal and efficiency driven institutions in the UK. This embodiment of research also enables me to think about how these positions of practice and of making embodied actions is itself a space of knowledge generation, and one that finds the capture or determination of these knowledges impossible in many ways. In Living Systemic Thinking (2004) Marshall gives the example of her colleagues and her reflecting on a review process of a student, to a fine grain of reflection, and shows how each person interprets these relations differently. She approaches this not to de-validate the difference and nuance but to work with these varied perspectives as other orientations of an issue, that form their own understandings of these actions and their relations to them (ibid, 15). Marshall's position on the embodiment of research also offers me to bring feelings and affect into practice, intersecting with a crip focus on affectivity. This navigation of embodiment informs my orientation of actions and their deliberation to not be led by but to account for how it has felt within the relations, how what is expected causes friction or how what I desire to undertake brings joy.<br>With this engagement of self, of bringing feelings into action, and those actions into inquiry and knowing they pose another way of orienting myself. Marshall and Gearty through their approach to LLI also ask of me to think about how I direct or orient myself, much like I discussed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a> section through the work of Ahmed. With LLI they think through how these practitioner and actioned knowledges that I practice, can in themselves form alternative orientations to those of hegemony and institutions. In an essay called Living Systemic Thinking (ibid) Marshall terms it as \"sense making\", and later on her and Gearty ask us to work with this sensing think through \"when to persist or desist\" (2021, 457) in direction. With this they present Living Life as Inquiry as a method to process what to inquire into and how to orient relational actions towards that outcome. To do this in this embodied context they work with a few notions to consider how to feel out what is appropriate to be done in that context. They talk about \"staying fresh and open\" (ibid, 455), where by taking life into inquiry, we question our habits, our sedimented patterns and norms to think through and feel out other approaches and paths to the outcome. To do this they propose \"checking for signs of vitality\" (ibid, 455) as a way to do pulse-checks, to ask \"How am I, here and now?\", and to balance between inquiring mindlessly forward and being stuck within the fine grain and frozen. They also pose these pulse-checks to be embodied and not always consciously reasoned to aim to unravel the notion of \"pursuit\" within research. This is where I can move away from a determined end goal or sedimented straight path and tending towards feeling out dynamic and emerging research to decide the next actions to make. They also bring up the notion of \"working with emotions\"( ibid, 456) as a way to inquire into \"what is really important\", of connecting to the issue on an embodied level and letting these feelings not determine but be engaged in what I feel I need to tend to.This leads onto their proposition of \"practices of discernment\" (ibid, 457), which interestingly isn't about where to act but more about when. As they note it can be about discerning when to be \"waiting things out\" and when to be working out \"what is what\" before deciding how to act, positioning Marshall's notion on \"when to persist or desist\" within time. Practising this within Ahmed's framing of inherited and sedimented relations makes room for me to think, where am I now, and what can I change within my reach. In a textural response to this notion Marshall and Gearty give the image of the Heron/yoga pose, of one leg in the water, of feeling the ripples and many forms of data lap against your body and to patiently discern what they mean and what/when to action. They follow this texture with their notion of \"the timely move to action\" (ibid, 458), which continues to ask how and when to take actions of inquiry but also where. In this embodied methodology they prompt us to think through where this can be in the relations we are entangled into, which can be an internal action on the self, or an \"inward action\" as they term it. In doing this though they don't divide between what they call the inward and outward arcs of action, but instead see them as performances of an entangled process. This prompts this research to re-scope where the actions of action research can be taken when embodied in research, and has pushed me as a practitioner to inquire into how I am internally orienting practices and how this is affected by and affecting outward actions.Following on from (but also maybe before/during) is their conception of reflection of action. Why I say maybe before/during is due to the troubling of the separation of action and reflection that LLI encourages. Instead with LLI Marshall and Gearty ask me to be open to the complex ways that these movements of action and reflection are entwined and interdependent, with reflection being in many ways an action in itself. Within this dialogue of reflection in mind they form another few notions to think with and help reflect on what matters within and around our actions. They ask us to revisit the \"inner and outer arcs of attention\" (ibid, 458), and that by taking time with both the internal embodied and external actions each will inform and develop the understanding of one another. Somewhat intersecting with crip theory they compare the entanglement of these arcs to that of the bodymind, and its move to dissolve the boundary between the two, where action and reflection move as one muscle. This is also closely read into in Living Systemic Thinking (2004) where Marshall takes up a close reading and reflection of their approach at each stage in line with feedback from colleagues to deliver a quality emerging inquiry into institutional processes through her enactment and relation to them.Returning to LLI they also work with the notion of \"the processual nature of inquiry\" (ibid, 459) that prompts us to approach these cycles of sense-making as ways to move beyond the determined and inherited generalised models of research and instead situate these orientating processes within the embodied practices of the researcher. In these modes of orienting they pose knowledge as ephemeral and fleeting as it sits within the relation of action and practice. They open to reflection that does not model, generalise and predetermine moments but evoke practice that makes room for me to visit the relations I engage in afresh to rethink the sedimented paths we take towards them. In this move and throughout the paper they also open up to what they call textures, such as the Heron description above, which takes the form of images, figures and reflections that act as experiments of how to express these feelings, practices and enquires where words may fail us. This orientation of modes of reflection within Action Research intersects well with a crip position, and one which I relate to a lot, where words can escape me. Here they make room for these discursive knowledges through embodied technical and social practices to be validated as generative ways of getting to know the relational \"problems\" at hand through other revealing practices. How drawing, metaphoring and coding can be ways to reflect and key modes of action, inquiry and sense-making. The last notion they leave us with is that of \"reviewing generative/degenerative aspects of inquiry\" (2021, 459), and is a very kind one that in many ways echo's that of pulse-checking. With this notion they discuss the balance you have to take in first-person inquiry to not get caught in self-critical cycles, which can stop actions from taking place and trap researchers inward. To manage this line they say to monitor what is being looked at, with degenerative inquiry being characterised by \"over-rumination or joylessness\". Here again aligning with a crip move to imagine disalignment as a generative site, and one where there is always a possibility of joy and pleasure. This is again where in places within myself and in relation to others, we can inquire into how these sites of friction as not invalidated and determined actions of humiliation, pain and duress, but how they make room for the possibility to be joyous and pleasurable places of inquiry.Bringing LLI into action in this research has empowered me undertaking it in a number of ways. It has made room for me to unfold and situate the research within my manys contexts and practices as a crip and queer researcher throughout the PhD. It has also prompted me to engage my feelings, bodily relations and emotions into an embodied research practice. It has given space to the technical and social practices I undertake, of thinking through code, finding frictions in coalition and of trying to survive within and around these institutions, as generative and informative textures of this research. It has also buffered these crip and queer notions of finding our own paths together, and that those are ones we desire, find vital and map to our bodies. In retrospect first person inquiry has given my research practice the capacity to change paths. For example a key turning point in this research is that through quality inquiry I decided to desist working with and for certain logics of automation and organisation that invoke and determine dominative centralised control and come from violent ableist and eugenics histories. Instead to step back, reorient and persist at the practice of social infrastructure that inform how to decentralise and disorient their technical counterpart through community interdependence and critical access.In this move to desist to then persist I found though that there were some crip frictions I have with this framing of LLI and Action Research here. Even though they counter narratives of pursuit and make rooms for finding my own way through embodied practices, their focus can be somewhat be Cripped more in relation to instituional processes. When Marshall references Meyerson and Scully's concept of \"tempered radicals\" (1999, 3) it is hard to imagine crip theory so normalised, subdued and conformed. Of course we get \"heated up and cooled down\" when \"being simultaneously outsider and insider\" of institutions, but it is not about getting \"tougher\". I know that in my inquiry I have moved, sometimes without reason from being tempered, to flexible, to brittle, to wet, to rusted, to loose and to tempered again. This isn't to say this divergence isn't possible within First Person AR, but the Crip orientation I desire aims to move beyond the need to be tempered towards institutional norms and our manifestings, as being tempered may make unlivable the many approaches to a crip notion of justice and radical access before they even begin. This is not to say being tempered and playing the valid role of \"user\" or \"expert\" to subvert or hack, or to reflect on the ways we emerge in relation to institutions are not valid in this critique. It is instead to disorient this table of action and to make known-able through critical access, the labours and their knowledges that these institutions invalidate. In relation to my experiences from and orientation to institutions and their imaginary possibility for these radical politics and social relations we call for is that they are limited through very restrictive terms that collectively in my collaborations, we can only form small amounts of wiggle room within and around. To find the space and relations that I desire and that can start to make room for these sorts of imaginary practices I turned disobediently from methods where I have to be tempered, and I have disoriented this through crip theory, interdependence and of movement making. This isn't to neglect the change I can and have made in the institution, but it is to pivot from crip futures they cannot hold. It is to make time and room to feel out my orientation towards these more restrictive and sedimented organisational practices of institutions, and figure out how to counter them. <br>\"quality (a term I prefer to 'validity')\" (Marshall, 2004, p. 3)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-1-6710f3169dcd68ce_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 04.02.00_Why-not-other_Action-ResearchIt is of course sensible to ask, and for me to reason why I have decided on First Person Action Research instead of other modes of AR. This is specifically true when it comes to Crip studies where the sedimented path into action research would be through participatory research. A quality example of this, and similarly to my research is the blurring of the lines of community and institution is Laura J. Wernick's Learning Disability Justice through Critical Participatory Action Research (2023). With this work she focuses on the notion of participatory to surface the ways that disabled interdependence is what has made her research happen. She also reflects on these exchanges in a very embodied, vulnerable and situated approach that a Crip studies approach encourages. This embodied mode being one that also crosses heavily into First Person Action Research. In my research I have similarly manifested it through these Crip support networks, through interdependence and from community, and I definitely do not want to underplay their participation in this work. I do though chose to orient towards First Person Action Research as I want to focus not so much on disabled people participating in the institutional norms or within disabled exclusive space, but instead towards how crip people as active change makers can transform the more intersectional organisations, institutions and systems around us. In this move putting pressure on, making friction with and giving feedback to the ableist institutions and relations we are in-touch with. This again isn't to say that the work like Wernick's that practice Participatory AR methods are not in reach of this change on their bodily horizon, but it is to instead orient towards this, and see how this imposition can change relations and politics around us.\n04.03.00_Disobedient-action-research\"This is how as a method it links to what we call \"disobedient action-research\", it invokes and invites further remediations that can go from the academic paper to the bug report, from the narrative to the diagrammatic and from tool mis-use to in-terface re-design to the dance-floor. It provides us with inscriptions, de-scriptions and re-in-terpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along.\" (Rocha and Snelting 2017, 45)This is the point when this first person action research becomes a disobedient form of Action Research. This is because it makes room for these practices to move away from and refuse the institutional and hegemonic norms that a crip orientation of justice also refuses. Much like the disobedient demand of the Crip Technoscience Manifesto which I work with, and moves to access through friction (Hamraie and Fritsch 2019, 10), disobedient action poses us to take direct actions now! It aims to form futures within and around institutes that can't hold them yet, and defiantly practice politics that they are not ready to imagine. In the essay 'We Have Always Been Geohackers' (2021) by Helen Pritchard, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting, they position the methodology of Disobedient Action Research as a means to re-scope and re-think how we practice questioning, maintaining and developing sociotechnical systems and infrastructures. As they pose it through this essay, what does it mean to debug a system in the context of computing, its institutions and politics that hold it in place. In the contexts and configurations of their interventions, they ask how normative/obedient debugging in open source communities often reinforces systems instead of questioning and transforming them. Through their analysis they focus on how breaking up the \"hardest problems\" into \"tiny\" and \"squeezable\" bugs can limit what can be said and done. This question can also be easily applied through crip studies, where we could ask how does fitting into and assimilating to the institution's \"squeezable\" terms of access actually limit the contingent possibilities of change we could make otherwise?In their essay they take up the debugging of Gplates, a free software tool and web-portal for tectonic plate modelling and mineral prediction for extraction. This debugging took place in a collective workshop where a group of non-technocrats, nor technical specialists produced their own independent knowledge, expertise and critiques of how these systems figure tectonic movements and their volumetric predictions of mineral resources. Through these non-hegemonic counter figures, the group questioned the naturalised aesthetics and navigational tools of Gplates. This includes questioning the representations of the globe's default as a blank grey orb awaiting to be projected on us by the god like viewer (+@fig:grey), reinforced through to the time slider that lets you smoothly slide through \"mega-annums of geological time\" (ibid, 250). In questioning the software through these actions and reflections, they open up conversations of what agencies does the earth, and those bodies living on it have (ibid, 252-53). When a software has tool names orientating \"grabbing\", especially around land, minerals and bodies, what semantics, meaning and use does this inscribe (ibid, 252).<br><img alt=\"Figure from the We have always been Gephackers chapter, which they caption &quot;Gplates interface before loading geodata (grey earth)&quot;\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/gplates_interface.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:grey}<br>Bringing these insights back to their critique of debugging. In this emerging practises that don't try to\"isolate\" these huge and complex issues so that they are squeezable within hegemonic logics of debugging. Instead try to feel out and validate situated, nuanced and ephemeral critiques that can't be reproducible for a developer or for a rigorous study. This is where they encourage me<a data-footref=\"q2\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-1-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> to be disobedient to these norms and instead of scaling down bugs, try to practice them across scales of time and space, displacing and intersecting the iterations and versions across software development.<br>Much like Ahmed's relating to lesbian roles of butch-femme as performances and not determined roles that I cover in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.02_Queering_the_axis.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.02_Queering_the_axis</a>, being disobedient doesn't aim to reject or discredit fields of expertise, practices, scales and knowledges that it works with but to trouble their performances and problematize their aftermath. This orients these disobedient actions, so I aim to feel their frictions and to question how technical systems are imagined, executed and orientated, moving to figure out how I (and others) can imagine and practise with them otherwise. Intersecting here with a crip set of political/relational scales, this refuses access and equality through assimilation or prescribed terms, but instead makes room to locally image sets of demands and actions to make. Here I reflect to Collin Kennedy, who is mentioned in the Crip Techniscience Manifesto, and I touched upon earlier in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>,. His refusal to pay to park, and access his care is radically out of the bugs an access form is imagined to hold, but also questions time, relational access, and capitalised care.<br>The Gplates debugging in We Have Always Been Geohackers (ibid) is only one of a number that they have taken on. These later impositions through their organisation The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest (TITiPI) and with many collaborators. Through these instances they are practising disobedience to the norms of big tech's expansive and violent development. They inquire into how they can gain purchase and get to grips with what they have capacity to change through challenging the sedimentations of norms and taking direct action to re-orient them now. Other examples of these intersections take place on github where through these disobedient terms of action research they enthusiastically are \"always-already entangled\"(Barad 2007). With \"The long tail of contact tracing\"(Aouragh, Pritchard, and Snelting 2020b; 2020a) they pose some of these \"Hardest Problems\" to contact tracing technologies during the Covid pandemic and their norms towards surveillance methods and discrimination on the DP-3T (Decentralised Privacy - Preserving Proximity Tracing ) documents repository. In the DP-3T repo<a data-footref=\"q3\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-2-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, as a place already somewhat critical of the hegemonic centralised norms of other contact tracing algorithms, welcomed these critiques and conversations, and these direct provocations evoked dialogue within that development community. Other repos did not respond in a similar way.<br>In EU Digital COVID Certificates: When governments move fast and break things (Aouragh et al. 2021b; 2021a) a critique of the EU DCC (Digital Covid Certificate), this was not the same case. Their commentary in the issue post/bug report was that a new idtoken which tracks each person's COVID status and (dis/en)ables them travel and move, as being something that we should be very cautious of. This is especially the case when there are no safeguards around who can read and use the data stored in the QR codes. This is also doubled by the fact that many of the medical infrastructures in Europe are not fully digitised, and this approach enforces them to \"scale up\" these specific digital surveillance systems immediately to comply. They point out that such quick move to restrictive measures through digital surveillance infrastructures will undoubtedly hit many issues, which in these cases will deeply affect the lives of people \"cared\" for by these systems. Here the disobedient debugging was not met by the same sort of reception as on the DP-3T post, but instead was within a day commented on<a data-footref=\"q4\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-3-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> to say it was in the wrong section (a technical forum) for this type of discussion. As in it was not a squeezable bug they would accept. It was then immediately closed and moved to a limited discussion for just private collaborators of the repo.Another example of disobedience from them is in their bug report of Frontier Climate (Aouragh et al. [2017] 2024a; [2017] 2024b) where they critique Big Techs selling of carbon credits and offset as a means to not reduce, but expand carbon exploration and dependency. This debugging showed a different face than the rest, as Frontier totally deleted the post. This move to delete, instead of the normative sideline, close down and avoid, shows the power of these comments and their direct actions to that company. It shows how these critiques if tabled could potentially reorient things, so have to be thrown off.<br>These disobedient intersections not only, as said in Pritchard's talk at 4S*EASST (2024), \"give feedback where it is not always wanted\", but in this direct action of giving feedback to them publicly it shows us how receptive these organisations and projects are to scaled up bugs. In their response we can publicly note if they listen and join the discussion. In this we can also feel them wriggle as they (not so) subtly restrict the bug to a side room away from discourse. When they give this feedback and try to get to grips with these scaled up buds, it is easy to know when they pull away, and into retreat as they delete the commentary from existence. In these disobedient actions they force the hand of the repository/software maintainer to not only engage with political commentary and critiques, but to also position themselves in relation to it publicly. Do they engage, avoid or squeeze these bugs however possible? are they too big for them to manage and so they avoid or do they feel their hold so delete them out of existence? Here I am thinking of disobedience as a practice to change how dynamics are performed to show relations, people and bodies under another spectrum, and to figure out what roles they perform when taken off script. Reflecting back to <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, these practices align with those of access as friction, and that of the \"non-compliant user\", wiggling room for dialogues where they have been silenced.Another key part of this \"giving feedback where it is not always wanted\" is that of making room for and building up this feedback that is not wanted. It is about collectively telling other stories of technologies, infrastructures and policies, than the rhetoric of their management. Here we can turn to TITiPI and friends work on infrables (2022), where they present methods for building up bugs from embodied and experienced relations of infrastructure. These methods not only build from those of first-person action research but also follow on from a crip orienting from the sites of impact of infrastructure and politics to inform the change needed. The work of infrables takes these processes on by developing a collaborative workshop and practice to unfold these other stories of Big Tech infrastructures. In this workshop practising ways to perform and transform anecdotes of infrastructures and their institutions into fables that can challenge those of mainstream and dominant narratives. Bringing this into crip centred methods, I turn to the work of Nat Decker and Cielo Saucedo's Cripping_Computer_Graphics (2023). Here they similarly offer up how cripping as method makes wiggle room for crip bodies within 3D environments, as well as wider relations and norms of computation institutions. Here taking up Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of \"cripping\" (2003, 37) as method to make room to feel the disorientations of crip bodies in relations to the norms of these technologies. Here they question how the diversity and many intersections of crip bodies disorient the normalised forms and mechanics of computer graphics, from the avatars to the ways they are rigged, and even how these virtual bodies are licensed and sold. Here they again make room for their crip expertise to question the sedimented bodies and limits of these systems.As I shared in the last two chapters the dominant terms are ones of silencing disabled and frictious voices to keep the narrative straight and to rule out any queries. By making room to tell these counter stories, and disobediently performing them as fables, this work aims to disorient how infrastructures and their aftermaths are felt and understood through centring the expertise and knowledges of the communities they are in touch with. These impact centred method are where I bring in these embodied elements of action research, of working with crip practitioner knowledge to animate the lines that are drawn and what is naturalised and sedimented as the norm. <br>\"We need a cross-platform, intersoftware, intracommunity, transgenealogical way of reporting that, instead of making bugs smaller, scales them up in time and space and that can merge untested displacements and intersections into its versioning ladder.\"(Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021, 250)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-1-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Repo or repository, is a place for storing code, files and resources, which is organised through a varying set of version control and management protocols that enable the owner to manage a stable up to date version of its content.<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-2-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"As this is not a technical issue with the specification, I will move this to the discussion forum.\"(Aouragh et al. 2021a)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-3-db1450e260de1de5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 04.03.01_Bringing Disobedience_Into_ActionWhen it comes to bringing these disobedient methods into my Action Research, I am informed by TITiPI's questioning of the roles and relations we play when debugging systems.

Here similarly I am presenting a pair of my inquiries into how I have been imagining my inquiring. These are presented as two textures and a figuring out through process and code that made room for me to conceptualise how these cycles of Action Research could and were undertaken. The first is from early on in my research, and is an animation focusing on action research as a cyclical process that emerges at other places through a building up of cycles. The second from later on where I was formulating more clearly this disobedient orientation to action research and taking the form of music visuals from collective and interactive poem writing, that is dynamically diagrammed into ever folding and interdependent loops, cycles and rhythms.\n04.04.01_Texture_1<br><img alt=\"A still from an animation I made where loops for internal and external cycles emerging and weaving forms of research\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/clyclez.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:cyclez}<br>At the beginning of this PhD I made this animation to reflect on how I was imagining Action Research as a method that would take me through loops of inner and outer arcs, ones that will build up, offset and emerge other forms of inquiry. Looking back at this animation the cycles presented imagine them as quite linear and deterministic. The form these cycles build up into are also somewhat walled in, hiding the inner arcs and sub-cycles of process. This texture gave me grip to get going, and has through inquiry emerged itself into the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"04.04.02_Texture_2.md\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.04.02_texture_2.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04.04.02_Texture_2</a>. This cycle got jolted open into these disobedient forms below through an inner arc of engagement with crip theory that emerged a desire to engage more deeply with those I am in coalition with as well as making what actions are and can be reachable through other disobedient practices. What can be unravelled and made barrier free.\n04.04.02_Texture_2<br><img alt=\"A screenshot of the work generating looped diagrams (top) from the collective etherpad (bellow)\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/pad_loop.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:loops}<br>This texture and artwork came about as I was trying to reflectively figure out how these disobedient actions had taken place. This texture takes the form of a poem visualiser that pulls from collective written texts in an etherpad and dynamically produces complex and indeterminate diagrams with a multiplicity of paths and connections between the lines/nodes of the poem (+@fig:loops). It is also made to be audio reactive so it can generate diagrams in-sync to music as visuals. This work was produced in collaboration with Sunni Liao and Yewen Jin (members of In-grid<a data-footref=\"q5\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-1-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>) for an event called In-grid.Real_bodies2.1<a data-footref=\"l1\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-2-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> that In-grid held in 2024 at Avalon Cafe and performed live in collaboration with the audience. The work acting as a texture in this research opens up the disobedient actions to be less determinable cycles and into poetic movements, both in content and connection. It also opens up these actions to be public, to be intersect-able, barrier free (ish) and accessible, moving from the isolated static spiral to instead be engulfed in the rhythms of music, dancing and collective being. Its context has moved from an isolated animation, and determinable rendering, through to making room for an accessible, dynamic and pleasurable tool or infrastructure, made with and for collaboration. In a disobedient move here this methodology refuses to isolate in this study and instead moves from the shared pad to the poem to the diagram to the dance floor to the here on the academic thesis (but also to the *****<a data-footref=\"q6\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fn-3-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>).<br>If you want to try it out, see what's happened there and maybe intersect into a texture of this methodology you can try it <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://georgie-png.github.io/etherpad-vis/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://georgie-png.github.io/etherpad-vis/\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>. <br>In-grid is a Trans*Feminist collective who I helped to set up and work with throughout this research.<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-1-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/real-bodies-2.1/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/real-bodies-2.1/</a><a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-2-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"This chronic job, by stating all the cron variables of time as *, refuses such linear computational metrics to instead hold the past*present*future, future*past*present, and * * * * * of crip times.\" (Simms and Marangoni 2025)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles.html#fnref-3-baa19170a94d5e97_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 04.05.00_What-was-Actioned<br>When it comes to summing up the actions taken for this project they are fairly entangled by the ways I have been taking many internal and external arcs of research through a number of contexts. I have though found it helpful to map these arcs into three movements, which are themselves covered by each of the following three chapters. These stages overlap and have greatly informed one another, as well as many happenings that do not quite fit into this thesis, but I found this approach helpful to orient these movements more accessibly. An initial sense-making stage of inquiry into <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> aims to figure out configuration methods by rubbing up against them and finding frictions with them from my crip axis. Through this I offer up the disobedient configure-able methods that emerges localised improvised collective configurations as affirming infrastructural and institutional re-configuring and hacking practices. I then move to practise these methods with what is in reach, and orienting towards collaborating with In-grid to figure out <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> as a place to collective orient our sociotechnical systems through critical access. This made room for us to try to distribute our capacity to manage and know these relations and in that movement also distribute the power and expertise in our relations. I also orient to try and put more disabled futures in reach by manifesting <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.00_Intro.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.00_Intro</a>, where I emerge a crip network infrastructure and collaboration that aims to crip and disorient these sociotechnical infrastructures through bringing with us crip politics of affirmation, care, access and the indeterminate embodied knowing and expertise of disabled bodies.Even though these are presented as distinct sections I want to encourage an understanding of how these movements have come into being together with the figure below. These overlapping and overflowing movements to me represent a disorienting from the prescribed and determined norms, and a orienting to crip politics, experience, need and desire.\n04.06.00_Ethical-considerations<br>In taking on this research and inquiry their of course have been many ethical relations to address. In my practice of ethics I have also queried these norms of the institutional forms of ethics, both in the ways they navigate ethics, but also how they template it for me to fill in. In this research this had been enacted by doing more traditional ethics forms for the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a> and the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> focus groups I have taken on, making sure they know what the research is, sign to consent, and have the ability to remove consent. In following these norms of course I have found friction along my Crip axis. One of places I have found friction is with the mandatory use of both ZOOM and Outlook, as being the ethical secure spaces for this research. This is because they are able to \"stably\" provide a service which fits to the tick-box regulations of GDPR, even with their fluctuating terms (Rob Pegoraro, 2023), and in doing so secure the stability of institutional contracts. Why I find friction is that Big tech models and tick-box economies that this research is trying to wiggle around, and so being forced to use them seems slightly unethical, and undermining. The unethical aspect also accentuated by the scales of these cloud economies, of the politics these infrastructures enforce when you use them, and the inability to orient otherwise in the inflexible hard systems. This was particularly true when it came to how to document my working together with others, both in workshops and focus groups. Here instead of orienting towards these infrastructures which in many ways reinforce research as surveillance, where we document exact words in time, hold people to them and orient arguments from them, I disoriented to forming collective notes, of taking time to care for what people wanted to say and to manifesting an inquiry together. This move for me not only ethically changes how we engage with the communities we work with and the infrastructures we meet them with, retreating from surveillance norms, but also as a researcher with fatigue it has reduced my labour hugely. This reduction in labour also making the research itself more ethical for me to take, and also opening up critique around what we might have capacity for in research, if we are not trying to hold these people and their words in place. It also orients to the critique that runs throughout this research, that representation and assimilation in sedimented technologies and their naturalised ethics isn't always that ethical, and we can find other disobedient ways to disorient these relations to our own crip and queer axes, desires and needs.This retreat from a particular type of individualised practise of research and ethics is highlighted in the way I have been undertaking my First Person Action Research. Here much like Marshall (Marshall, 2004), I have initiated focus groups with those I have inquired into working with. These have been enacted through a-synchronous collective reflections, based through my drafted inquiries and signal chat (groups), and where I invited feedback from others and room for them to add their own perspective. Orienting towards this direction has brought much joy into this research, as I reflect back with collaborators and companions on our times together, of how it has emerged into compounding reflections and unfolding actions. This felt quite vulnerable for me to do, and I definitely delayed and anxiously avoided it for a while, but it has also added much more depth to my research and made room for me reconsider my normalised and sedimented paths toward these inquiries. 04.07.00_ConclusionIn this chapter I have presented the methodology that my research project has undertaken. As I have shown, it aims to hold together both the embodied practices and resulting knowledges that the crip and queer framing I have previously formulated makes room for and embraces. These methods informed by and developed through disobedient and direct actions within different collaborations and coalitions.<br>In reflection of and in tandem with the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access</a>'s two textures evoked earlier, I am pleased with the ways these actions have unfolded in practice. This has taken my practice from a place of predominantly isolated technical practise to one of orienting on the tables of interdependent action and change within ongoing and emerging groups. This work disobediently follows the line of AR and ILL to understand these projects and practises as ever ongoing. I personally find this wiggle room for continuation cozy, opening up possibilities for how I can collectivley action crip manifestings within diverse localities which are yet to unfold.\npandoc_orderinput-files:\n./04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\n./04.01.00_Action-research.md\n./04.02.00_Why-not-other_Action-Research.md\n./04.03.00_Disobedient-action-research.md\n./04.03.01_Bringing

Disobedient Action ResearchInquring into InquiryMethods In ActionThis section brings into focus why this research has oriented towards action research as a methodology. Following on from the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> chapter and its framing of embodied and relational politics I have found that action research aligns and intersects at a number of places that are key. To trace these crossing lines I am working with Judi Marshall's notion of Living Life as Inquiry (LLI) (Gearty and Marshall 2021; Marshall 1999) and Living Systemic Thinking (Marshall 2004) that make room for me to not only take on the calls for action I have made in the previous chapter but also to bring into those actions the necessary reflection that quality inquiry and research entails<a data-footref=\"31\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-1-261b3ef7f68a4cc6_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.Marshall's LLI (1999; 2004; Gearty and Marshall 2021) work is a specific type of action research named first person action research, which is where the first intersection crosses paths with my proposed framework. In first person action research Marshall is in many ways practicing a methodology that makes room for the background of the practitioner to settle in, like Ahmed (2006), and brings in the context, relations and feelings of the person making the research. In her essay Living Life as Inquiry -- a Systemic Practice for Change Agents (2021) with Margaret Rose Gearty, which acts as a 20 year celebration and retrospective since the paper and method was first published and to examine how LLI has been taken up in many orientations. There are a number of focuses in this essay on how Living Life as Inquiry can be practised but there is a key focus on how it makes room for an embodiment of research. Marshall phrases it as \"Inquiry has woven itself into my life\" (2021, 454). This embodiment and weaving of research into life is key for my practice as it makes room for me to wiggle into this research, my experiences of being crip and queer within and around institutional limits and their relations. It let's me situate this research to my context, to think through what it means for me as a middle class 'white', crip and queer researcher, with chronic illness, pain and fatigue to be approaching deeply neo-liberal and efficiency driven institutions in the UK. This embodiment of research also enables me to think about how these positions of practice and of making embodied actions is itself a space of knowledge generation, and one that finds the capture or determination of these knowledges impossible in many ways. In Living Systemic Thinking (2004) Marshall gives the example of her colleagues and her reflecting on a review process of a student, to a fine grain of reflection, and shows how each person interprets these relations differently. She approaches this not to de-validate the difference and nuance but to work with these varied perspectives as other orientations of an issue, that form their own understandings of these actions and their relations to them (ibid, 15). Marshall's position on the embodiment of research also offers me to bring feelings and affect into practice, intersecting with a crip focus on affectivity. This navigation of embodiment informs my orientation of actions and their deliberation to not be led by but to account for how it has felt within the relations, how what is expected causes friction or how what I desire to undertake brings joy.<br>With this engagement of self, of bringing feelings into action, and those actions into inquiry and knowing they pose another way of orienting myself. Marshall and Gearty through their approach to LLI also ask of me to think about how I direct or orient myself, much like I discussed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a> section through the work of Ahmed. With LLI they think through how these practitioner and actioned knowledges that I practice, can in themselves form alternative orientations to those of hegemony and institutions. In an essay called Living Systemic Thinking (ibid) Marshall terms it as \"sense making\", and later on her and Gearty ask us to work with this sensing think through \"when to persist or desist\" (2021, 457) in direction. With this they present Living Life as Inquiry as a method to process what to inquire into and how to orient relational actions towards that outcome. To do this in this embodied context they work with a few notions to consider how to feel out what is appropriate to be done in that context. They talk about \"staying fresh and open\" (ibid, 455), where by taking life into inquiry, we question our habits, our sedimented patterns and norms to think through and feel out other approaches and paths to the outcome. To do this they propose \"checking for signs of vitality\" (ibid, 455) as a way to do pulse-checks, to ask \"How am I, here and now?\", and to balance between inquiring mindlessly forward and being stuck within the fine grain and frozen. They also pose these pulse-checks to be embodied and not always consciously reasoned to aim to unravel the notion of \"pursuit\" within research. This is where I can move away from a determined end goal or sedimented straight path and tending towards feeling out dynamic and emerging research to decide the next actions to make. They also bring up the notion of \"working with emotions\"( ibid, 456) as a way to inquire into \"what is really important\", of connecting to the issue on an embodied level and letting these feelings not determine but be engaged in what I feel I need to tend to.This leads onto their proposition of \"practices of discernment\" (ibid, 457), which interestingly isn't about where to act but more about when. As they note it can be about discerning when to be \"waiting things out\" and when to be working out \"what is what\" before deciding how to act, positioning Marshall's notion on \"when to persist or desist\" within time. Practising this within Ahmed's framing of inherited and sedimented relations makes room for me to think, where am I now, and what can I change within my reach. In a textural response to this notion Marshall and Gearty give the image of the Heron/yoga pose, of one leg in the water, of feeling the ripples and many forms of data lap against your body and to patiently discern what they mean and what/when to action. They follow this texture with their notion of \"the timely move to action\" (ibid, 458), which continues to ask how and when to take actions of inquiry but also where. In this embodied methodology they prompt us to think through where this can be in the relations we are entangled into, which can be an internal action on the self, or an \"inward action\" as they term it. In doing this though they don't divide between what they call the inward and outward arcs of action, but instead see them as performances of an entangled process. This prompts this research to re-scope where the actions of action research can be taken when embodied in research, and has pushed me as a practitioner to inquire into how I am internally orienting practices and how this is affected by and affecting outward actions.Following on from (but also maybe before/during) is their conception of reflection of action. Why I say maybe before/during is due to the troubling of the separation of action and reflection that LLI encourages. Instead with LLI Marshall and Gearty ask me to be open to the complex ways that these movements of action and reflection are entwined and interdependent, with reflection being in many ways an action in itself. Within this dialogue of reflection in mind they form another few notions to think with and help reflect on what matters within and around our actions. They ask us to revisit the \"inner and outer arcs of attention\" (ibid, 458), and that by taking time with both the internal embodied and external actions each will inform and develop the understanding of one another. Somewhat intersecting with crip theory they compare the entanglement of these arcs to that of the bodymind, and its move to dissolve the boundary between the two, where action and reflection move as one muscle. This is also closely read into in Living Systemic Thinking (2004) where Marshall takes up a close reading and reflection of their approach at each stage in line with feedback from colleagues to deliver a quality emerging inquiry into institutional processes through her enactment and relation to them.Returning to LLI they also work with the notion of \"the processual nature of inquiry\" (ibid, 459) that prompts us to approach these cycles of sense-making as ways to move beyond the determined and inherited generalised models of research and instead situate these orientating processes within the embodied practices of the researcher. In these modes of orienting they pose knowledge as ephemeral and fleeting as it sits within the relation of action and practice. They open to reflection that does not model, generalise and predetermine moments but evoke practice that makes room for me to visit the relations I engage in afresh to rethink the sedimented paths we take towards them. In this move and throughout the paper they also open up to what they call textures, such as the Heron description above, which takes the form of images, figures and reflections that act as experiments of how to express these feelings, practices and enquires where words may fail us. This orientation of modes of reflection within Action Research intersects well with a crip position, and one which I relate to a lot, where words can escape me. Here they make room for these discursive knowledges through embodied technical and social practices to be validated as generative ways of getting to know the relational \"problems\" at hand through other revealing practices. How drawing, metaphoring and coding can be ways to reflect and key modes of action, inquiry and sense-making. The last notion they leave us with is that of \"reviewing generative/degenerative aspects of inquiry\" (2021, 459), and is a very kind one that in many ways echo's that of pulse-checking. With this notion they discuss the balance you have to take in first-person inquiry to not get caught in self-critical cycles, which can stop actions from taking place and trap researchers inward. To manage this line they say to monitor what is being looked at, with degenerative inquiry being characterised by \"over-rumination or joylessness\". Here again aligning with a crip move to imagine disalignment as a generative site, and one where there is always a possibility of joy and pleasure. This is again where in places within myself and in relation to others, we can inquire into how these sites of friction as not invalidated and determined actions of humiliation, pain and duress, but how they make room for the possibility to be joyous and pleasurable places of inquiry.Bringing LLI into action in this research has empowered me undertaking it in a number of ways. It has made room for me to unfold and situate the research within my manys contexts and practices as a crip and queer researcher throughout the PhD. It has also prompted me to engage my feelings, bodily relations and emotions into an embodied research practice. It has given space to the technical and social practices I undertake, of thinking through code, finding frictions in coalition and of trying to survive within and around these institutions, as generative and informative textures of this research. It has also buffered these crip and queer notions of finding our own paths together, and that those are ones we desire, find vital and map to our bodies. In retrospect first person inquiry has given my research practice the capacity to change paths. For example a key turning point in this research is that through quality inquiry I decided to desist working with and for certain logics of automation and organisation that invoke and determine dominative centralised control and come from violent ableist and eugenics histories. Instead to step back, reorient and persist at the practice of social infrastructure that inform how to decentralise and disorient their technical counterpart through community interdependence and critical access.In this move to desist to then persist I found though that there were some crip frictions I have with this framing of LLI and Action Research here. Even though they counter narratives of pursuit and make rooms for finding my own way through embodied practices, their focus can be somewhat be Cripped more in relation to instituional processes. When Marshall references Meyerson and Scully's concept of \"tempered radicals\" (1999, 3) it is hard to imagine crip theory so normalised, subdued and conformed. Of course we get \"heated up and cooled down\" when \"being simultaneously outsider and insider\" of institutions, but it is not about getting \"tougher\". I know that in my inquiry I have moved, sometimes without reason from being tempered, to flexible, to brittle, to wet, to rusted, to loose and to tempered again. This isn't to say this divergence isn't possible within First Person AR, but the Crip orientation I desire aims to move beyond the need to be tempered towards institutional norms and our manifestings, as being tempered may make unlivable the many approaches to a crip notion of justice and radical access before they even begin. This is not to say being tempered and playing the valid role of \"user\" or \"expert\" to subvert or hack, or to reflect on the ways we emerge in relation to institutions are not valid in this critique. It is instead to disorient this table of action and to make known-able through critical access, the labours and their knowledges that these institutions invalidate. In relation to my experiences from and orientation to institutions and their imaginary possibility for these radical politics and social relations we call for is that they are limited through very restrictive terms that collectively in my collaborations, we can only form small amounts of wiggle room within and around. To find the space and relations that I desire and that can start to make room for these sorts of imaginary practices I turned disobediently from methods where I have to be tempered, and I have disoriented this through crip theory, interdependence and of movement making. This isn't to neglect the change I can and have made in the institution, but it is to pivot from crip futures they cannot hold. It is to make time and room to feel out my orientation towards these more restrictive and sedimented organisational practices of institutions, and figure out how to counter them. <br>\"quality (a term I prefer to 'validity')\" (Marshall, 2004, p. 3)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-1-261b3ef7f68a4cc6_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n04.01.00_Action-researchIt is of course sensible to ask, and for me to reason why I have decided on First Person Action Research instead of other modes of AR. This is specifically true when it comes to Crip studies where the sedimented path into action research would be through participatory research. A quality example of this, and similarly to my research is the blurring of the lines of community and institution is Laura J. Wernick's Learning Disability Justice through Critical Participatory Action Research (2023). With this work she focuses on the notion of participatory to surface the ways that disabled interdependence is what has made her research happen. She also reflects on these exchanges in a very embodied, vulnerable and situated approach that a Crip studies approach encourages. This embodied mode being one that also crosses heavily into First Person Action Research. In my research I have similarly manifested it through these Crip support networks, through interdependence and from community, and I definitely do not want to underplay their participation in this work. I do though chose to orient towards First Person Action Research as I want to focus not so much on disabled people participating in the institutional norms or within disabled exclusive space, but instead towards how crip people as active change makers can transform the more intersectional organisations, institutions and systems around us. In this move putting pressure on, making friction with and giving feedback to the ableist institutions and relations we are in-touch with. This again isn't to say that the work like Wernick's that practice Participatory AR methods are not in reach of this change on their bodily horizon, but it is to instead orient towards this, and see how this imposition can change relations and politics around us.04.02.00_Why-not-other_Action-ResearchWhen it comes to bringing these disobedient methods into my Action Research, I am informed by TITiPI's questioning of the roles and relations we play when debugging systems. In this thinking about the scales, relations and capacities we need to make room for the communities, technologies and change we desire right now. This disobedience intersecting with the crip cyborg (Kafer 2013), and the health rebel (Kafer 2017), engaging with and stepping out of line from the violent norms of computational systems and institutional logics. In doing this I am also turning to see how these practices of forming counter narratives, figures and manifestings of sociotechnical fables can be brought into action in the making of collective infrastructures. Asking how can my collaborators and I imagine other ways of relating with these technologies in retreat from their violent origins and contemporary uses and towards manifesting our own imaginaries and politics around them.With a queer disobedience I also take actions through transdisciplinary approaches which echo Ahmed's wiggle room (2014) loosening of determined roles to performances. In this wiggling making room with this disobedience for the roles and discipline within research, forming queer lines between them. Here I aim to perform these disciplines with respect and to high quality but along my own lines that subvert the ones they were prescribed to as isolated institutional discipline.<br>Disobedience has also been taken along inward arcs of action and into my internal enquiry and practice. I do this to think through how I can orient my inquiry by being in touch with the relations I am entangled in as a crip and queer researcher. This has taken the work mentioned in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction to this research, being individually focused and technologically centred practice, to now being disorient by collective bodies and practices that orients the social of infrastructure, with the assistance of technical. Taking up disobedient action research made room for me to desist from engaging in what felt like assimilation practices of computing, to then move to persist with other ways of imagining crip capacities for care, coalition and interdependence.<br>Throughout the research there is a returning to a disobedient motion. This can be read in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> with experiences of surviving institutions through refusal. There is also disobedience in my work of <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> and the forming of a critical access informed approach to the configuration organisations and infrastructure. These disobedient crip methods centres points of impact and frictions to figure out localised interdependent ways towards collective infrastructural relations. These disobedient methods are also taken into the two later inquiries of <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.00_Intro.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.00_Intro</a>, where I explore them in action with different collaborators. This disobedience is also overflowing from this research in the ways the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../09_Conclusion/08_Conclusion.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">08_Conclusion</a> covers, of how these methods are already unfolding into future projects and infrastructures made with and for communities through disobedient intersectional queer feminist and crip practices of manifesting action now.04.03.01_Bringing Disobedience_Into_Action\"This is how as a method it links to what we call \"disobedient action-research\", it invokes and invites further remediations that can go from the academic paper to the bug report, from the narrative to the diagrammatic and from tool mis-use to in-terface re-design to the dance-floor. It provides us with inscriptions, de-scriptions and re-in-terpretations of a vocabulary that is developing all along.\" (Rocha and Snelting 2017, 45)This is the point when this first person action research becomes a disobedient form of Action Research. This is because it makes room for these practices to move away from and refuse the institutional and hegemonic norms that a crip orientation of justice also refuses. Much like the disobedient demand of the Crip Technoscience Manifesto which I work with, and moves to access through friction (Hamraie and Fritsch 2019, 10), disobedient action poses us to take direct actions now! It aims to form futures within and around institutes that can't hold them yet, and defiantly practice politics that they are not ready to imagine. In the essay 'We Have Always Been Geohackers' (2021) by Helen Pritchard, Jara Rocha and Femke Snelting, they position the methodology of Disobedient Action Research as a means to re-scope and re-think how we practice questioning, maintaining and developing sociotechnical systems and infrastructures. As they pose it through this essay, what does it mean to debug a system in the context of computing, its institutions and politics that hold it in place. In the contexts and configurations of their interventions, they ask how normative/obedient debugging in open source communities often reinforces systems instead of questioning and transforming them. Through their analysis they focus on how breaking up the \"hardest problems\" into \"tiny\" and \"squeezable\" bugs can limit what can be said and done. This question can also be easily applied through crip studies, where we could ask how does fitting into and assimilating to the institution's \"squeezable\" terms of access actually limit the contingent possibilities of change we could make otherwise?In their essay they take up the debugging of Gplates, a free software tool and web-portal for tectonic plate modelling and mineral prediction for extraction. This debugging took place in a collective workshop where a group of non-technocrats, nor technical specialists produced their own independent knowledge, expertise and critiques of how these systems figure tectonic movements and their volumetric predictions of mineral resources. Through these non-hegemonic counter figures, the group questioned the naturalised aesthetics and navigational tools of Gplates. This includes questioning the representations of the globe's default as a blank grey orb awaiting to be projected on us by the god like viewer (+@fig:grey), reinforced through to the time slider that lets you smoothly slide through \"mega-annums of geological time\" (ibid, 250). In questioning the software through these actions and reflections, they open up conversations of what agencies does the earth, and those bodies living on it have (ibid, 252-53). When a software has tool names orientating \"grabbing\", especially around land, minerals and bodies, what semantics, meaning and use does this inscribe (ibid, 252).<br><img alt=\"Figure from the We have always been Gephackers chapter, which they caption &quot;Gplates interface before loading geodata (grey earth)&quot;\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/gplates_interface.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:grey}<br>Bringing these insights back to their critique of debugging. In this emerging practises that don't try to\"isolate\" these huge and complex issues so that they are squeezable within hegemonic logics of debugging. Instead try to feel out and validate situated, nuanced and ephemeral critiques that can't be reproducible for a developer or for a rigorous study. This is where they encourage me<a data-footref=\"q2\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-1-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> to be disobedient to these norms and instead of scaling down bugs, try to practice them across scales of time and space, displacing and intersecting the iterations and versions across software development.<br>Much like Ahmed's relating to lesbian roles of butch-femme as performances and not determined roles that I cover in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.02_Queering_the_axis.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.02_Queering_the_axis</a>, being disobedient doesn't aim to reject or discredit fields of expertise, practices, scales and knowledges that it works with but to trouble their performances and problematize their aftermath. This orients these disobedient actions, so I aim to feel their frictions and to question how technical systems are imagined, executed and orientated, moving to figure out how I (and others) can imagine and practise with them otherwise. Intersecting here with a crip set of political/relational scales, this refuses access and equality through assimilation or prescribed terms, but instead makes room to locally image sets of demands and actions to make. Here I reflect to Collin Kennedy, who is mentioned in the Crip Techniscience Manifesto, and I touched upon earlier in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>,. His refusal to pay to park, and access his care is radically out of the bugs an access form is imagined to hold, but also questions time, relational access, and capitalised care.<br>The Gplates debugging in We Have Always Been Geohackers (ibid) is only one of a number that they have taken on. These later impositions through their organisation The Institute for Technology in the Public Interest (TITiPI) and with many collaborators. Through these instances they are practising disobedience to the norms of big tech's expansive and violent development. They inquire into how they can gain purchase and get to grips with what they have capacity to change through challenging the sedimentations of norms and taking direct action to re-orient them now. Other examples of these intersections take place on github where through these disobedient terms of action research they enthusiastically are \"always-already entangled\"(Barad 2007). With \"The long tail of contact tracing\"(Aouragh, Pritchard, and Snelting 2020b; 2020a) they pose some of these \"Hardest Problems\" to contact tracing technologies during the Covid pandemic and their norms towards surveillance methods and discrimination on the DP-3T (Decentralised Privacy - Preserving Proximity Tracing ) documents repository. In the DP-3T repo<a data-footref=\"q3\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-2-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, as a place already somewhat critical of the hegemonic centralised norms of other contact tracing algorithms, welcomed these critiques and conversations, and these direct provocations evoked dialogue within that development community. Other repos did not respond in a similar way.<br>In EU Digital COVID Certificates: When governments move fast and break things (Aouragh et al. 2021b; 2021a) a critique of the EU DCC (Digital Covid Certificate), this was not the same case. Their commentary in the issue post/bug report was that a new idtoken which tracks each person's COVID status and (dis/en)ables them travel and move, as being something that we should be very cautious of. This is especially the case when there are no safeguards around who can read and use the data stored in the QR codes. This is also doubled by the fact that many of the medical infrastructures in Europe are not fully digitised, and this approach enforces them to \"scale up\" these specific digital surveillance systems immediately to comply. They point out that such quick move to restrictive measures through digital surveillance infrastructures will undoubtedly hit many issues, which in these cases will deeply affect the lives of people \"cared\" for by these systems. Here the disobedient debugging was not met by the same sort of reception as on the DP-3T post, but instead was within a day commented on<a data-footref=\"q4\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-3-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> to say it was in the wrong section (a technical forum) for this type of discussion. As in it was not a squeezable bug they would accept. It was then immediately closed and moved to a limited discussion for just private collaborators of the repo.Another example of disobedience from them is in their bug report of Frontier Climate (Aouragh et al. [2017] 2024a; [2017] 2024b) where they critique Big Techs selling of carbon credits and offset as a means to not reduce, but expand carbon exploration and dependency. This debugging showed a different face than the rest, as Frontier totally deleted the post. This move to delete, instead of the normative sideline, close down and avoid, shows the power of these comments and their direct actions to that company. It shows how these critiques if tabled could potentially reorient things, so have to be thrown off.<br>These disobedient intersections not only, as said in Pritchard's talk at 4S*EASST (2024), \"give feedback where it is not always wanted\", but in this direct action of giving feedback to them publicly it shows us how receptive these organisations and projects are to scaled up bugs. In their response we can publicly note if they listen and join the discussion. In this we can also feel them wriggle as they (not so) subtly restrict the bug to a side room away from discourse. When they give this feedback and try to get to grips with these scaled up buds, it is easy to know when they pull away, and into retreat as they delete the commentary from existence. In these disobedient actions they force the hand of the repository/software maintainer to not only engage with political commentary and critiques, but to also position themselves in relation to it publicly. Do they engage, avoid or squeeze these bugs however possible? are they too big for them to manage and so they avoid or do they feel their hold so delete them out of existence? Here I am thinking of disobedience as a practice to change how dynamics are performed to show relations, people and bodies under another spectrum, and to figure out what roles they perform when taken off script. Reflecting back to <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, these practices align with those of access as friction, and that of the \"non-compliant user\", wiggling room for dialogues where they have been silenced.Another key part of this \"giving feedback where it is not always wanted\" is that of making room for and building up this feedback that is not wanted. It is about collectively telling other stories of technologies, infrastructures and policies, than the rhetoric of their management. Here we can turn to TITiPI and friends work on infrables (2022), where they present methods for building up bugs from embodied and experienced relations of infrastructure. These methods not only build from those of first-person action research but also follow on from a crip orienting from the sites of impact of infrastructure and politics to inform the change needed. The work of infrables takes these processes on by developing a collaborative workshop and practice to unfold these other stories of Big Tech infrastructures. In this workshop practising ways to perform and transform anecdotes of infrastructures and their institutions into fables that can challenge those of mainstream and dominant narratives. Bringing this into crip centred methods, I turn to the work of Nat Decker and Cielo Saucedo's Cripping_Computer_Graphics (2023). Here they similarly offer up how cripping as method makes wiggle room for crip bodies within 3D environments, as well as wider relations and norms of computation institutions. Here taking up Dr. Carrie Sandahl terming of \"cripping\" (2003, 37) as method to make room to feel the disorientations of crip bodies in relations to the norms of these technologies. Here they question how the diversity and many intersections of crip bodies disorient the normalised forms and mechanics of computer graphics, from the avatars to the ways they are rigged, and even how these virtual bodies are licensed and sold. Here they again make room for their crip expertise to question the sedimented bodies and limits of these systems.As I shared in the last two chapters the dominant terms are ones of silencing disabled and frictious voices to keep the narrative straight and to rule out any queries. By making room to tell these counter stories, and disobediently performing them as fables, this work aims to disorient how infrastructures and their aftermaths are felt and understood through centring the expertise and knowledges of the communities they are in touch with. These impact centred method are where I bring in these embodied elements of action research, of working with crip practitioner knowledge to animate the lines that are drawn and what is naturalised and sedimented as the norm. <br>\"We need a cross-platform, intersoftware, intracommunity, transgenealogical way of reporting that, instead of making bugs smaller, scales them up in time and space and that can merge untested displacements and intersections into its versioning ladder.\"(Pritchard, Rocha, and Snelting 2021, 250)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-1-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Repo or repository, is a place for storing code, files and resources, which is organised through a varying set of version control and management protocols that enable the owner to manage a stable up to date version of its content.<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-2-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"As this is not a technical issue with the specification, I will move this to the discussion forum.\"(Aouragh et al. 2021a)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-3-8f3cfdbd4b50d127_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n04.03.00_Disobedient-action-researchThis title pulls from a heading of the same name in Living Life as Inquiry (2021, 445) where Gearty and Marshall undertake inquiry into how LLI has been undertaken in the prior 20 years since its conception. Here similarly I am presenting a pair of my inquiries into how I have been imagining my inquiring. These are presented as two textures and a figuring out through process and code that made room for me to conceptualise how these cycles of Action Research could and were undertaken. The first is from early on in my research, and is an animation focusing on action research as a cyclical process that emerges at other places through a building up of cycles. The second from later on where I was formulating more clearly this disobedient orientation to action research and taking the form of music visuals from collective and interactive poem writing, that is dynamically diagrammed into ever folding and interdependent loops, cycles and rhythms.04.04.00_Inquiring-into-inquiry<br><img alt=\"A screenshot of the work generating looped diagrams (top) from the collective etherpad (bellow)\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/pad_loop.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:loops}<br>This texture and artwork came about as I was trying to reflectively figure out how these disobedient actions had taken place. This texture takes the form of a poem visualiser that pulls from collective written texts in an etherpad and dynamically produces complex and indeterminate diagrams with a multiplicity of paths and connections between the lines/nodes of the poem (+@fig:loops). It is also made to be audio reactive so it can generate diagrams in-sync to music as visuals. This work was produced in collaboration with Sunni Liao and Yewen Jin (members of In-grid<a data-footref=\"q5\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-1-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>) for an event called In-grid.Real_bodies2.1<a data-footref=\"l1\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-2-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> that In-grid held in 2024 at Avalon Cafe and performed live in collaboration with the audience. The work acting as a texture in this research opens up the disobedient actions to be less determinable cycles and into poetic movements, both in content and connection. It also opens up these actions to be public, to be intersect-able, barrier free (ish) and accessible, moving from the isolated static spiral to instead be engulfed in the rhythms of music, dancing and collective being. Its context has moved from an isolated animation, and determinable rendering, through to making room for an accessible, dynamic and pleasurable tool or infrastructure, made with and for collaboration. In a disobedient move here this methodology refuses to isolate in this study and instead moves from the shared pad to the poem to the diagram to the dance floor to the here on the academic thesis (but also to the *****<a data-footref=\"q6\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fn-3-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>).<br>If you want to try it out, see what's happened there and maybe intersect into a texture of this methodology you can try it <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://georgie-png.github.io/etherpad-vis/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://georgie-png.github.io/etherpad-vis/\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>. <br>In-grid is a Trans*Feminist collective who I helped to set up and work with throughout this research.<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-1-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/real-bodies-2.1/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/real-bodies-2.1/</a><a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-2-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"This chronic job, by stating all the cron variables of time as *, refuses such linear computational metrics to instead hold the past*present*future, future*past*present, and * * * * * of crip times.\" (Simms and Marangoni 2025)<a href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_disobedient_action_research_cycles_canvas.html#fnref-3-92db3c49f7742683_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n04.04.02_Texture_2<br><img alt=\"A still from an animation I made where loops for internal and external cycles emerging and weaving forms of research\" src=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_media/clyclez.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:cyclez}<br>At the beginning of this PhD I made this animation to reflect on how I was imagining Action Research as a method that would take me through loops of inner and outer arcs, ones that will build up, offset and emerge other forms of inquiry. Looking back at this animation the cycles presented imagine them as quite linear and deterministic. The form these cycles build up into are also somewhat walled in, hiding the inner arcs and sub-cycles of process. This texture gave me grip to get going, and has through inquiry emerged itself into the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"04.04.02_Texture_2.md\" href=\"04_disobedient_action_research_cycles/04_entries/04.04.02_texture_2.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04.04.02_Texture_2</a>. This cycle got jolted open into these disobedient forms below through an inner arc of engagement with crip theory that emerged a desire to engage more deeply with those I am in coalition with as well as making what actions are and can be reachable through other disobedient practices. What can be unravelled and made barrier free.04.04.01_Texture_1<br>This chapter follows on from the framing of the last two chapters to discuss how I have formed a methodology for this research project. The methodology I have taken up is a situated implementation of disobedient action research. This disobedience and its foundations of action research follows the many crip and queer figures that were called on in the last chapter, and especially within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a>, where it demands to step out of line, to find other routes that institutional inflexibilities do not have the capacity for and to defiantly take those actions now.In this move to shake off the the academic table of methods that holds us in-line, I turned to action research as a place to empower the position of practitioners (in this case collaborators and I) as a knowledge creators. This methodology approaches these experiences by giving depth and insight to relations where an embodied framing makes room for it to be understood in action, from a situated perspective and knowledge. I then move to orient this methodology through first person action research, where I bring in the background of my research and to make room within it for a situated embodiment of these inquiries. From this position and that of my crip framing, I felt this research necessitates a disobedient approach, one that manifests a disorientation of the scope and norms of the actions within action research. It poses this work to take on direct actions together right now! Of refusing to be a part of, assimilate to and be quiet about certain politics and their violent relations!After this setting up of a disobedient action research methodology I go on to discuss how I have taken up this methodology in three (ish) cycles of action and reflection, and how they have been approached at different intersections of social and technical infrastructures within and around institutions.04.00_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles<br>When it comes to summing up the actions taken for this project they are fairly entangled by the ways I have been taking many internal and external arcs of research through a number of contexts. I have though found it helpful to map these arcs into three movements, which are themselves covered by each of the following three chapters. These stages overlap and have greatly informed one another, as well as many happenings that do not quite fit into this thesis, but I found this approach helpful to orient these movements more accessibly. An initial sense-making stage of inquiry into <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a> aims to figure out configuration methods by rubbing up against them and finding frictions with them from my crip axis. Through this I offer up the disobedient configure-able methods that emerges localised improvised collective configurations as affirming infrastructural and institutional re-configuring and hacking practices. I then move to practise these methods with what is in reach, and orienting towards collaborating with In-grid to figure out <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a> as a place to collective orient our sociotechnical systems through critical access. This made room for us to try to distribute our capacity to manage and know these relations and in that movement also distribute the power and expertise in our relations. I also orient to try and put more disabled futures in reach by manifesting <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/06_entries/06.00_Intro.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.00_Intro</a>, where I emerge a crip network infrastructure and collaboration that aims to crip and disorient these sociotechnical infrastructures through bringing with us crip politics of affirmation, care, access and the indeterminate embodied knowing and expertise of disabled bodies.Even though these are presented as distinct sections I want to encourage an understanding of how these movements have come into being together with the figure below. These overlapping and overflowing movements to me represent a disorienting from the prescribed and determined norms, and a orienting to crip politics, experience, need and desire.04.05.00_What-was-Actioned<br>In taking on this research and inquiry their of course have been many ethical relations to address. In my practice of ethics I have also queried these norms of the institutional forms of ethics, both in the ways they navigate ethics, but also how they template it for me to fill in. In this research this had been enacted by doing more traditional ethics forms for the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a> and the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> focus groups I have taken on, making sure they know what the research is, sign to consent, and have the ability to remove consent. In following these norms of course I have found friction along my Crip axis. One of places I have found friction is with the mandatory use of both ZOOM and Outlook, as being the ethical secure spaces for this research. This is because they are able to \"stably\" provide a service which fits to the tick-box regulations of GDPR, even with their fluctuating terms (Rob Pegoraro, 2023), and in doing so secure the stability of institutional contracts. Why I find friction is that Big tech models and tick-box economies that this research is trying to wiggle around, and so being forced to use them seems slightly unethical, and undermining. The unethical aspect also accentuated by the scales of these cloud economies, of the politics these infrastructures enforce when you use them, and the inability to orient otherwise in the inflexible hard systems. This was particularly true when it came to how to document my working together with others, both in workshops and focus groups. Here instead of orienting towards these infrastructures which in many ways reinforce research as surveillance, where we document exact words in time, hold people to them and orient arguments from them, I disoriented to forming collective notes, of taking time to care for what people wanted to say and to manifesting an inquiry together. This move for me not only ethically changes how we engage with the communities we work with and the infrastructures we meet them with, retreating from surveillance norms, but also as a researcher with fatigue it has reduced my labour hugely. This reduction in labour also making the research itself more ethical for me to take, and also opening up critique around what we might have capacity for in research, if we are not trying to hold these people and their words in place. It also orients to the critique that runs throughout this research, that representation and assimilation in sedimented technologies and their naturalised ethics isn't always that ethical, and we can find other disobedient ways to disorient these relations to our own crip and queer axes, desires and needs.This retreat from a particular type of individualised practise of research and ethics is highlighted in the way I have been undertaking my First Person Action Research. Here much like Marshall (Marshall, 2004), I have initiated focus groups with those I have inquired into working with. These have been enacted through a-synchronous collective reflections, based through my drafted inquiries and signal chat (groups), and where I invited feedback from others and room for them to add their own perspective. Orienting towards this direction has brought much joy into this research, as I reflect back with collaborators and companions on our times together, of how it has emerged into compounding reflections and unfolding actions. This felt quite vulnerable for me to do, and I definitely delayed and anxiously avoided it for a while, but it has also added much more depth to my research and made room for me reconsider my normalised and sedimented paths toward these inquiries. 04.06.00_Ethical-considerationsIn this chapter I have presented the methodology that my research project has undertaken. As I have shown, it aims to hold together both the embodied practices and resulting knowledges that the crip and queer framing I have previously formulated makes room for and embraces. These methods informed by and developed through disobedient and direct actions within different collaborations and coalitions.<br>In reflection of and in tandem with the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access</a>'s two textures evoked earlier, I am pleased with the ways these actions have unfolded in practice. This has taken my practice from a place of predominantly isolated technical practise to one of orienting on the tables of interdependent action and change within ongoing and emerging groups. This work disobediently follows the line of AR and ILL to understand these projects and practises as ever ongoing. I personally find this wiggle room for continuation cozy, opening up possibilities for how I can collectivley action crip manifestings within diverse localities which are yet to unfold.04.07.00_Conclusion05_Configure-able

chapter covers the initial inquiry of my research, and the coalescing together of crip theory and critical access with that of Feminist Science and Technologies Studies (STS). In this chapter I wiggle together these research tables to make room for Configure-able methods to emerged from this research. This inquiry does feel a little like a second literature review in some places, and this is because I wanted to centre my approach from Crip studies within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> and in this chapter coalesce this with more of an accessible understanding of Feminist STS methods. To emerge this methodology I first trace a genealogy of configuration from its routes in figure and figuring (Lury et al., 2022) to that of Suchman’s definition of Configuration (2012). I then disorient it with an -able and critiques of critical access (Hamraie, 2017) and crip studies (Kafer, 2013) to question how configuration can be shaped when brought into contact with the dispersed and indeterminate practices, bodies and expertise of access in action. In reflection of my experiences configuring access for the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops I ran at NEoN I offer how critical access as a practice and method centres indeterminate localities and imperfect improvisations instead of the determined curative hard plans which forcefully shapes bodies and systems. With both Hamraie and Kafer, I question what the problem is within configurations, cripping it from isolated individualised issues to relational constraints of centralised plans. With this disorientation I also question how sedimented roles of user/designer/expert, prescribed/prescriber, or ethnographer/community can be reconfigured from the sites of impact and frictions within collective practices.

In the intro chapter to their Figure Concept and Method book they define two propositions of figure, one as a noun and one as a verb. The difference in the two is key, as I will share, as it takes us from passive and inherited determined figures, and stories of a world, to being able to figure out our own stories and relations with each other and technologies.To define figure as a noun, they first build up from Erich Auerbach’s (2013) tracing of its etymology within “Figura” in Latin. Figura developed from a constellation of technical Greek words that orient the materiality of things and plays between plasticity and form within their shaping. Auerbach raises the tension within Figura which came about to think through this delineation of both the material and conceptual elements of an object. In a sense this meant that within western discourse Figura, or later figures, became a place to pivot or orient our understanding of the material through the conceptual. Figures are sedimented into christian doctrine, where stained in glass they can be understood as a way of forming futures from pasts<a data-footref=\"1a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.01.00_figure.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, making prophesy from historic fables. Quoting Hayden White, Lury et al.&nbsp;states that the use of figures to represent this exchange is “Western culture’s unique achievement of identifying reality as history”(1999, 96). In this motion of prefiguring, Auerbach understands a flow of figuring that deterministically moves into set configurations of material practices and the limited scoping of their possibility.When brought into the fields of social and political studies Figures are used in multiple ways. Lury et al. highlights Norbert Elias (1987) as a sociologist who focuses on the relationality and interdependence of persons and the ways this can figure their configuration. In his work he states it is the role of a social scientist to understand how these configurations bind them to their subject another (ibid., 79). This understanding of figures as relational practices forms the base for figurational sociology. In these figurational practices we start to understand that figures are not determined prototypes, but act as stories in motion, plastic and performable. Lury runs through a few of these performances of figures in relation, moving from an isolated and disinterested flâneur by Charles Baudelaire through to Walter Benjamin’s crowd (2003). In doing this she not only shares the plasticity of the figure, but also how in their relationality they are lived through.<br>The final critique Lury et al. (2022, 4) make of the figure as a noun is of its western context, of the list of white men referenced to manifest it here in writing. In the most part, they point out that within this relational practice of the figure is a practice of differencing and division<a data-footref=\"2a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.01.00_figure.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. To examine this division further they take up Alexander G. Weheliye’s critique of “racialisation” (2014) as a crucial axis. With Weheliye they question sedimented figures by moving from following what they scope to questioning how they are scoped. Through this inversion of their approach to figures it can be understood as a probing tool, one for reflecting on and feeling out our means of producing knowledge.<br>Interestingly this movement of inverting the figure to understand its maker also resonates with the move of the social model of disabilitie’s inversion of the medical model which I talk more about in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model</a> entry. In this move the social model's inversion of sedimented power relations and their practices, even though useful to understand certain aspects of power, can in some ways miss the nuance of relations. With a crip approach I look to trouble this by exploring how a figure can of course be inverted, but also what other relations and practices can I make room for when I choose to feel the frictions between figures and their backgrounds.<br>Figuring as a verb takes on the action of forming figures, of figuring things out and of composing or computing figures. within this diversity of forms and use of figure there is a focus on the tactility of thinking when we are working through them. Taken as method figuring makes room to apprehend the shape of something, of feeling out a figure, collating one together, and making wiggle room for another one to join. In this figuring out of space, much like with the noun, is this division of what is brought into being a figure and what is backgrounded to contour that figure. Lury et al. approaches this with Edgar Rubin’s psychological research into perception (1958), where his depiction of figure and ground are defined by the “contour” that runs between them. They give the example of the “Rubin vase”<a data-footref=\"3a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.01.00_figure.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. With Ahmed I could similarly ask what contingent approaches and practises do I rely upon, turning back to them when feeling out contours of bodily-horizons, as I have not found another path I yet desire, or another background to figure out from. This is especially true within disability studies where the figure of the crip is only just disobediently emerging into discourse of other fields, and has always been kept in the background. With my crip figuring out it is to make wiggle room around these sedimented norms for this disabled figure to be contoured among, and with it the demands of critical access and disobedient relational politics of crip theory. <br>“The Old Testament “pre- figures” the New Testament, past and future are symbiotically shaped in, and indeed incarnated by, typology: Word made flesh\" (Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 2)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.01.00_figure.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>“the fig-ure of “man” figures who gets to be considered human by means of a series of constitutive exclusions (Mbembe 2017).

Lury et al. (ibid., 8) define configuring as a practice within complex systems design that makes room to join diverse elements into arrangement, never final even when \"stable\". It doesn’t refer to the final arrangement of components, but instead this practise of coalescing them together. Due to configuring being this process of bringing figures into action, as well as bringing the diverse elements of infrastructure together, it has been taken up by Science Technology Studies (STS) as a cornerstone critical methodology and mode of analysis. Lury et al.&nbsp;here points to Lucy Suchman’s definition of Configuration to demonstrate how this methodology can make room to inquire with “[a]t once action and effect”(2012, 49). Suchman’s definition makes room to understand how the stories that are told and the figures that are held in place produce specific sedimented practices of ordering. In configuration as method she makes room for a mode of analysis that can be an un/remaking through material practises and their knowledges. Lury et al.&nbsp;go on to trace configuration through the work of D. N. Rodowick (2001), Michel Foucault’s notion of similitude(2020), as well as Donna Haraway’s “string figures”(1997) and her Cyborg Manifesto (1985), which I touch on more in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. These movements by Lury et al.&nbsp;in many ways orients towards their understanding of Elizabeth Povinelli (2016) and Michelle Murphy (2017) work as practices of forming figures “equal to contemporary political configurations”(Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 10). Configure-Able Methods as I will go on to offer up, moves with these approaches of forming counter figures, but also (un)fixes these practices through impact centred design methods of critical access. Here making room to form wiggle room through these counter figures to disorient configurations from their sites of impact and friction.<br>To understand the importance of the (un)fixing and disorientation of -able further I am going to return to Suchman’s definition in her Configuration essay (2012) that Lury et al.&nbsp;touches on. This deeper reading of Suchman’s Configuration is due to it making room for me to understand why and how my research finds the need to disorient configuration through impact centred critical access methods and my disobedient methods. In doing this I am not aiming to de-legitimise this field, or Suchman's work, but to dance with them and to trouble the sedmineted norms they emerge from. In fact Suchman is taken up here as a refined version of STS, and an axis of STS for which I can disobediently crip and disorient configuration from. The other key reason for choosing Suchman’s definition is that in this essay she takes up medical infrastructures and with them the infrastructures of disability. Much like Alison Kafer’s taking up of disability within Haraway’s cyborg, which I discuss in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. I am taking up a definition of configuration where disability is in the background but not yet made known or brought in reach of the research. Here I am making wiggle room within these STS methods for the disabled figure to emerge and with them disobediently bringing their crip politics, methods, practices and approaches.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Configuration","level":3,"id":"Configuration_0"}],"links":[".html",".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.00_configuration.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612915,"modifiedTime":1756048612915,"sourceSize":3735,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.01.02.00_Configuration.md","exportPath":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.00_configuration.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html":{"title":"05.01.02.01_The STS axis","icon":"","description":"In Suchman’s essay (ibid.) she gives two examples both covering self-proclaimed bench mark digital infrastructure projects within health. The first inquiry around an speculative one fits all data management system for one of the largest health management organisation (HMO) in the US by Judith Gregory (2000) and the second around the government of rural Andhra Pradesh (India) and their implementation of their ‘Vision 2020’ policy, which undertook the implementation of a new health information infrastructures and documented by C. R. Ranjini (2007; 2006). I closely read into these two inquiries later in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section in this chapter, but Suchman brings them together to offer up and reflect on their misfitting between plans and actions, or in these examples the determined datafied figures and their indeterminate material backgrounds. In both examples Suchman shares that these systems inevitably fail, not because their task of creating comprehensive healthcare tools is impossible, but because of the efficient, normalising, and reductive imaginaries and politics that they were operated through. As I shared earlier in this chapter with the brief summary of configuration Suchman uses this framework to think through how the figures, metrics and imaginaries, work in action. With configuration she brings together both the ways in which “technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technical artefacts” (Suchman 2012, 48). In doing this she brings in-line how we plan, imagine and narrate things being done (often sedimented from a centralised, generalised and prescribed approach), with how it is situated through localised practises and material bodily horizons. By bringing these things in-line she aims to form configuration as a method of analysis which can making sense of the reverberations and frictions between situated knowings of systems through practise and the roles and figures which they can be reconfigured through. These two inquiries present this reverberation on each of their own system and infrastructure's bodily horizon to offer up what configuration as method is, and demonstrating how their sedimented norms can be radically disoriented through contingent practises of configuration.<br>The language I use at the end of the last paragraph is intentionally muddled with Ahmed’s from Queer Phenomenology (2006). This is not only because Ahmed’s work frames my research but also because Suchman’s configuration is also framed through Ahmed’s theories. Instead of Queer Phenomenology though, Suchman builds up from Ahmed’s figure of “the stranger”(2000). In this analysis she shares how Ahmed forms the stranger not as one who is unknown, but instead is recognised as the stranger. Much like the line that divides the family table, that I talk about closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a>, Suchman takes up Ahmed’s line of inherited delineation to show how “inside(r)s and outside(r)s” are drawn and sedimented. Suchman works with this to show how “the stranger” is formed through citing Marx’s commodity fetishism and reorients it into ‘a fetishism of figures’(Ahmed 2000, 4) that can hold the fantasy and materiality of things together in a plastic form. Suchman later in the essay follows up this figure of the stranger by asking how to trouble the divide between user/designer/expert, and the inherent division between those who can configure out systems for strangers and those how have to live by strangers' figures.<br>Working from these two examples Suchman defines configuration through a rigid STS axis. This aims to take up examples which situate the work by embedding the STS expert within the field, through interviews, shadowing practitioners and researching paperwork. In some ways being embedded here for STS still means being a stranger, as quality research is only achieved through an exterior expert collating information to figure out these configurations reverberations. Suchman would debate this, as she does in her essay with Karen Barad’s notion of “Agency”(2007)<a data-footref=\"2b\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> where she reminds us that we are entangled within the apparatus no matter our delineation. I very much agree with this but within the framework set out with Ahmed’s table, I ask how much is in reach from these rigid STS positions? And how can I disorient configuration by making room for my communities to reverberate between our matters and how we figure them out.Especially in the context of this research, of refusing big tech complicity and figuring out other approaches to cloud computing and community infrastructures, it could be asked why not turn to a more recent example of configuring methods? It would be very logical to look to something like Louise Amoore's Cloud Ethics (2020), where the centralised role of the expert is dispersed to those in touch with each other and the infrastructures. Her methodology also aligns with mine, where these challenges are made through counter figures, of telling narratives or stories, making songs and contextualising configurations in messy localities. I instead take this step back to Suchman's configuration (2012) not just because it helps to accessibly demonstrate the genealogy of configuration, but also as she takes up disabled matters, and life-affirming infrastructures. I later go on to show in cripping configuration that both Suchman and Amoore still seem to negate and invalidate disabled voices, politics and theory within their dialogues. In the next section's inquiry I firstly offer up how practices of critical access are in themselves radical impact centred configuring practices, and ones that configuring life-affirming infrastructures. In doing this I then return to this STS axis to share the necessity of this inflection of access, and why indeed we need to centre crip politics and practices in these debates, not negate and invalidate them. <br>“As Barad reminds us, we are always already inside the worlds that we take as the objects of our actions” (Suchman 2012, 57)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Science Technology Studies (STS) Axis","level":4,"id":"Science_Technology_Studies_(STS)_Axis_0"}],"links":["05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0",".html","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612915,"modifiedTime":1756048612916,"sourceSize":6317,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_The STS axis.md","exportPath":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.01.02.01_the-sts-axis.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html":{"title":"05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access","icon":"","description":"In this next section I bring this genealogy of configuration out of line and queer it with this research’s cripping axis of inquiry. To do this I aim to translate the inflection of access-able to to that of configure-able through a tracing of access-knowledge and critical access. With this disorientating inflection I aim to inform the STS methods of configuration through those of Aimi Hamraie's tracing of flexible users (2017) and their understanding of access-knowledge. To do this I take into focus my own experiences of organising access for others as well as requesting access myself as inquiries into configuring practices informed through access-knowledge.To start this inquiry into critical access it is interesting to first turn to -able as a suffix or as what I am calling here an inflection. -able or -ible’s etymology is traced from middle English, that comes from a French incursion of “-able”, and an empirical root in Latin with “-abilis”. This suffix’s etymology inflects “-able” to orient towards that of being able to do something, to enter, to be free from constraint or even gifted, but more specifically worthy of doing that thing or of being free. This sedimented line of “-able” being about worth is one that we still feel to this date, where questions of disabled people being worthy of access to basic care and a standard quality of life is still seemingly an open debate in the uk <a data-footref=\"41\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Instead here, I orient to take a step back and disobediently retreat from these normative terms of -able and think through how critical access and crip studies might disorient it otherwise. Interestingly on the retreat we may pass the Old English suffix of “-endlic” that “-able” straightened out and overruled. “-endlic” instead of focusing on the value or worthiness of the subject, focuses on the material capacity. Inflecting a word with it means it is capable to, or able to do something. Why I stop here to catch a breath on the retreat is because it denotes a key aspect of critical access that I want to highlight. It is not about a person being worthy of access, but it is to orient access as a collective flexibility to do what we can materially, and to be honest and open about those flex-abilities, capacities and contours. Kafer poses an understanding of flexibility as \"not just extra time\" (2013, p.27) for disabled people, where \"rather than bend disabled bodies and minds to meet the clock, crip time bends the clock to meet disabled bodies and mind\"(ibid, p.27). This is similarly reflected on by Aimi Hamraie's tracing of the flexible user and the human factor (2017) within eugenics, industrial engineering and ergonomics beginning in the nineteenth century. The flexible \"user\" traced by Hamraie emerges from mass prosthetic manufacture after the world wars and poses soft human bodies, and the emergent human factor they make up within systems design, to be malleable problems to be cured by being shape by and for hard normalising systems and their processes. This in contemporary critiques is highlighted in the work of Renyi Hong's \"plasticity\" (2024), but especially in his critique of curative platforms (2024). This is where big tech platforms, like \"Grab, a leading superapp platform in Southeast Asia\", form narratives of disabled bodies as empowered by flexible work within a system and making room for them to choose when to work. In action thought this resulted pushing people with disabilities into precarious work and unsafe working environments, which never resulted in them having stability, agency or being empowered. It forced them to be flexible to the clock and processes of the app, and did not make room for or imagine their indeterminate bodies or their wider relational frictions.In response to these design politics Hamraie offers up the history of access-knowledge and of disabled people as knowers and makers to disorient hard machines to be flexible to softer bodies and build up the capacities within them for indeterminate crip bodies and their situated horizons. When we orient to how crip studies is practised around access in academia (Abrams, Floyd, and Abes 2024; Evans et al. 2024), and also from my own experiences of providing it, it is this place where we question the flexibility of the sedimented hard relations and politics of institutions, from the ways they conform disabled bodies within times, categories and metric figures, to how these invalidating practices validate and bring peoples needs into dialogue.\n“The disability to come . . . will and should always belong to the time of the promise. . . . it’s a crip promise that we will always comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively, somehow access other worlds and futures.”\n—Robert McRuer, Crip Theor (McRuer and Bérubé 2006)\nIn the appendices of Feminist queer and crip Kafer (2013, 171–78) quotes McRuer above, before sharing her own materials from her practises of access. In this quote and in Kafer’s placement of it I interpret this “crip promise” that opens up crip futures as a promise of access that we make to ourselves and others around us. This promise of access for me is a call for life affirmation. It is a disorienting and inflecting action that moves towards affirming lives through emergent daily practices of access. By orienting life-affirmation on indeterminate access I don’t aim to determine what it is or can be, but aim to configure out the practices that can make room for life affirmation to be know-able through access in action. Stating access as a promise orients not as a static set of “universal” solutions or cures, such as the historic \"one best way\" (2017, p. 61) that Hamraie critiques. In this practise I know this is not something I can master or cure and there will never be a determinate \"one bast way\" or a solution to access. As Hamraie's forms it access-knowledge is produced through \"Flexible knowing (knowledge of a range of embodiments) and flexible design (designing for those embodiments)\", that form needs and access outcomes from situated bodies and not generalised or prescribed normid bodies. Hamraie shares the histories of access knowledge through the reverberation of section 504, and where barrier free access started to come into equality laws. In this recollection they share the many misfitting, iterations and localisations of these laws, as disable activists tried to make room in the generalised state and international level access laws for the situated diverse needs of the people with disability within America. These range form the ways mandatory policies were made advisories when taken to other states (turned into extra time), how barrier free access was scoped towards more traditionally socially visible disabilities, and how institutionalised barrier free access also pushed for circulation and visibility of disabled people, instead of giving them agency over their lives.<br>This troubling and reverberating of the rulers line through access-knowledge itself comes to a position of validating the collective labours, the possibility of institutional flexibility and the situated knowledges that it takes to be in a place or relation together. Bringing this back to Kafer, she demonstrates her access-knowledge through practise of making scent free spaces, and where the expanded relational understanding of access it undertakes is explicit. This is where all participant must be intimate with this room, considerate about what they clean themselves with and how they can stay chemical free until they reach this room. With Johanna Hedva’s Sick Woman Theory (2016) they also think through the ways access-knowledge troubles the normative roles of activism, and asks how can their be more room for expressions from those who cannot always be there in person due to illness, capacities or other life commitments. Hedva here transforms the understanding of what it is we can offer when we show up for justice. Another recollection of the many contexts of access-knowledge in action is Ren Britton's On Rehearsing Access (Britton, 2024) where access riders and their request are taken up as hacking tools to make room and flexibility in communities and institutions so disabled people can thrive within them. These patterns and practices of access knowledge differ greatly from a model of centralised control seen not only in the medical model, but also politics of neo-liberal austerity and their efficiency policies and imaginaries of sociopolitical infrastructures. In Suchman’s examples as I go on to share in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, some of my own in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a>, as well as Ahmed and Kafer’s work that i discuss in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a>, we have offered up how the pivotal action in centralised control is a holding of a determined line in place through invalidating penal logics, which almost always negate and silence the material relations, sense making and feedback of bodies. Understanding access knowledge as a promise of flexibility instead of a checklist (Kafer 2017), approaches it as an ongoing process of situated negotiation and a radical space of flexing lines and wiggling room for crip folks to participate how they feel able and desire to. This indeterminate promise and practice of access knowledge in action can seem overwhelming in the way that it is non-prescriptive, in need of deep intimacy and care as well as often admitting to not really have the capacity to meet the full needs of people. Saying this though I have been finding comfort in returning to this -endlic inflection of -ability, turning it from worth and towards capacity. Access in these terms takes so many paths converging and diverging between communities and institutions at each situated and messy locality, lines being drawn and woven together to configure a holey tapestry. The spaces missed and gaps out of reach of our communities thread giving form and horizon to this body, forming contours around what access is and can be. Here I am inquiring into how I approach my capacities when configuring access through a critical flexibility that aims to go between these divergent points, become intimate with the lines that divides the expertise within my communities and orient to practices of going into the unknown together. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cj937xylzyet\" target=\"_self\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cj937xylzyet</a><a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Inquiring into Critical access","level":2,"id":"Inquiring_into_Critical_access_0"}],"links":["05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0",".html",".html","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612916,"modifiedTime":1756048612916,"sourceSize":10735,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical Access.md","exportPath":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.00_inquiring-into-critical-access.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html":{"title":"05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration","icon":"","description":"Access in my research can be addressed and understood in so many of the actions I have taken, from running events, making websites and infrastructures, learning to communicate and wiggle room with collaborators and even how I write academically right here. This has led me to reflect deeply on access-knowledge not only as a flexibility and capacity we build up around institutions and their norms through practice but also as one of the most divergent sites of impact to reconfigure complex systems from. By inquiring into access knowledge as configuration in practise, I aim to share how disability studies has inform my capacities for making room for the indeterminate needs and material limits of people and technologies around the sedimented norms of institutions. I have already written a lot on the many times I have encountered frictious access prepared by others and made me feel out of place, like at the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> or the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, or access that has made me feel understood and affirmed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>. Here though, I find it more pressing to share my experiences and inquiries around forming access with and for others, as well as reflecting on my requesting of access from institutions as reconfiguring practicises. Inquiring into these orientations, of both access requester towards institutions and collective provider within community work, I aim to trouble the sedimented division of user/designer/expert roles in practises of configuring access. This inquiry gives shape to configure-able methods, and how I aim to approach and care for these normalised institutional limits, forming wiggle room within and around them. In doing this though, I also aim to not so easily collapse pre-configure roles, like users, workshop participants and presenter, but instead be intimate with the intersectional capacities of those involved and how each person can orient themselves in locality together to configure collective access. To render this inquiry around Configure-Able methods I will focus on an initial attempt to meet people's access needs at a workshop I ran and which has inform the initial emergence of these methods. This was a workshop called Configure-Able Infrastructures I organised with NEoN digital. This was both my first attempt at a UKRI funded Knowledge Exchange (KE) but more importantly here, it was my first clear attempt at putting on an accessible workshop, and so has given me many misfittings, frictions and disorienting factors to reflect and learn from. These workshops were manifested as a place to explore and exchange dialogues of digital accessibility outside of big tech services, and was hosted by NEoN Digital Arts, a community based organisation focusing on digital access. I invited two groups to share their work. One was M.E.L.T. a crip digital arts collaboration of Ren Britton and Iz Paehr, presenting their Access Server work. The other person I invited was Ai Carmela from SysterServer to accessibly share technical skills of feminist network practices. These workshops in retrospect worked out okay for my first attempt at an accessible workshop, but left me quite anxious about how well I had managed it. This was in part not just because access in action is a steep learning curve when coming from the ableist norms of academic institutions and open-source community alike. From these institutions, flexibility is not asked but silently/violently demanded of the user, students, researchers or person approaching them, as our soft crip bodies and needs are stretched to fit the valid normid user's capacities and form. This being said these frictions and misfittings provide a quality example of how access-knowledge understood as configuration can be a generative tool for analysing the relations, politics, norms and imaginaries holding the current configurations of systems in place and which don't let them contextually flex to the soft bodies or needs they come in touch with in context.The focus of this inquiry is to reflect on the demands for bodies to be flexible by both academic and open-source institutional inflexibility in action. I also focus on the response to institutional inflexibility and the room for flexibility within the constellation of producers and presenters running the workshop. In this I aim to demonstrate how institutional norms reinforce roles of user/designer, prescribed/prescriber, where as communities actioned through forms of critical access can make wiggle room within how they contextualising their roles and relations beyond what is sedimented as inflexible. I will begin by orienting towards the workshops use of Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). I as an organiser had decided to try to run the workshop using FLOSS platforms and services hosted by different communities. This was mainly out of curiosity of what access was possible within FLOSS, but also to attempt a refusal to flex to the ableist norms of academia and big tech. The friction we had here originated from M.E.L.T. but reverberated among us, and came about due to this being an online workshop where we wanted to provide people with captions to access the workshops. The budget for this KE event was limited, so I oriented towards using auto-captions, and paying the presenters what I could. In trying to configure out a FLOSS video call with auto-captioning, I realised that this just did not exist (within reach). Default installs of Jiitsi did not have it, and even though there was some documentation on how to do it, I had not found an instance of it. With Big Blue Button (BBB) it had room for manual captioning but no wiggle room to automate it. This absence was overpowering in some ways, and showed how the Ableist norms of FLOSS did not centre accessibility or find it central to its future development. Access is very much was extra time for FLOSS. It also surfaces that if we want to be flexible to people's access needs we have to all flex to the inflexible politics, relations and protocols of big tech as the \"one best way\". Here though we refused their inflexibility and instead oriented towards forming access around FLOSS and away from big tech. To do this I providing a detailed “how to” for setting up a captioning system on a local machine. This sharing of knowledge and improvising of infrastructure made wiggle room for flexibility around how people improvise configurations of access-able alternatives to complicit big tech platforms. It also shares how through collaborative action we both felt design frictions, but made room to bridge that gap, improvise and flex the hard machines to wiggle some room within these misfittings for one afternoon. From this friction also came a generative conversation with Sabrina at NeoN, talking about auto-captioning compared to live captioning by a professional person or sonographer. We talked about how live-captioning by a person is not only more accurate but is itself a practice and an art form where they can add in more context but also creativity in the way they represent the dynamics and relations of what is being said. Here I did not want to replace the people who practice these vibrant and generative art forms, professions, and practitioners knowledges with clumsy and uniformed automation. When I think through access oriented like this, and as centring art and creaivity it again transforms the narrative of access from one of a burden and constraint, to one of joy and pleasure. In Lousie Hickman's video essay Crip AI (2021), she takes this into even closer detail to question how these histories of crip centred practices of sonographers are being overuled and left out of the dialogue when automating their practices and creative captions. Hamraie also shares how this is something of a norm when industrial design models approach disability, or even across fields. This is where these approaches do not navigate the methods, context or history of a field but just bluntly apply their own one best way of efficient design to it. With crip theory this unquestioned and prescribed move to the automation of access can also be understood as being more about relational politics which forcefully isolating disabled people by investing in ways to reduce funds for creative and intimate human centred practices of access-knowledge, care and joy within disabled lives. This isn't to say we shouldn't invest in their development, or to exclude the disabled people that might prefer these technologies to a person, but it is to make space for the option. It is like Hickman's Crip AI, which lays down the terms of if this is happening to us, we are making room in it to bring are backgrounds with us.Being honest in these workshops it was a mix of institutional inflexibility from KE funds to not support this type of access by default but also my unknowing of how to access more funds that led me to improvise this automated access. Here though instead of have the capacity to make room for better access and the captioning as art and joy full, we did manifest ways to form automated access without being entangled in the complicit \"one best way\" of big tech. With this I aim to demonstrate how these access frictions not only formed a generative place for us to locally and collectively analyse the configuration of automated creative captions and FLOSS, but also materially configure our own improvised alternatives then and there.From another orientation emerged a second friction from this workshop, with just as much inflexibility but this time coming from the academic institution. This friction came from the simple action of getting funds to pay individuals that had already been awarded to me to run from UKRI through the KE scheme. This fairly simple task became inaccessible to me, not because the money was not declared, but because the process itself was not clear or accessible, leaving me un-agential and unable to do this simple task. The background to this moment is that efficiently my departments admin team had been fired and they had hired new people but not trained them. In doing so made the practices they were hired to do inaccessible to both them and to requesting staff like me. In my context this meant spending months emailing back and forth with these admin \"experts\" trying to get them to pay the participants the money that was allocated for them. The lack of access here was shown in how I, as an early career researcher doing these things for the first time did not know exactly what to tell the admin person. In the opposite direction as a un-trained administrator, nor could they guide me to the right forms and process. In full there was no flex-ability for us to meet in the middle (even with a slight gap).I ended up resolving this by reaching out to my supervisor, who advised me on emailing another experienced admin who was more experienced and flexible. They managed to get the payments for participants sorted in one afternoon, slightly less that three months. Even still here there were complexities with getting some people paid due to state regulations. This shows how this configuration of knowledge exchange by academic institutions and their funding bodies like UKRI only make room for certain imagined bodies or normid users to be present and felt, those that know who to ask, and what form to fill in already, no matter those let on the campus or in the state. In this inflexibility these institutions making certain other sorts of research by those not used to these sedimented processes slow to almost static. In this case here, if a person needed help accessing the administrational logics of these institutions or sit in the grey areas of state regulations you are waylaid and invalidated from sharing your knowledge, experience and practices in this ecology, or at least getting paid to do so. This systemic institutional invalidation, hiding and silencing of certain bodies and experiences is well known, but what I highlight here is that it was again us as a group who made room for and improvised a local flexible collective access within this institutional background so that it could come into contact with and be reoriented by these radical access frictions and their generative knowledges.<br>Moving on from the frictions within the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops, I now move to trouble the role of requesting access from institutions through relational and political crip demands and the room that makes for reconfiguration. Here I am reflecting on the calls for friction in the Crip Tehcnoscience Maifesto (Hamraie &amp; Fritsch, 2019), of making direct actions of access, of cutting curbs in barriers, politics and sociotechnical relations. Here though I want to share how requesting access to institutions on these crip terms can create wiggle room and flexibility in these hard systems not only the individuals life of the requester, but those in a wide scope of crip intersectional politics and struggle. This sees access as community leverage and interdependent resistance using these systems to enable refusal of certain politics but also most importantly care for other orientations. Hamraie and Fritsch's examples present direct action towards normalised ableist public infrastructure, but here I wiggled room into an access request I made to an institution that brought in these intersectional crip politics. This maybe aligns more with what Britton writes in On Rehearsing Access (Britton, 2024), and quoting Hedva's Access Rider<a data-footref=\"1m\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where they ask what real and permanent change their demands of access can make to institutions. The request I am reflecting on here is when I produced an audio piece for Tate’s electric dream FM on crip big-tech disobedience, where I talked about fermenting foods and feelings as a crip erotic technology. This was their accessible audio exhibition that accompanied the Electric Dreams retrospective, which presented an impressive catalogue of arts at the intersection of science and technology before the internet. Here in this extra time around the exhibition for access, I used this platform to not only highlight crip erotics of care, embodied practice and disobedient relational refusal, but most importantly here, test what access as a request can enable when thought understood as intersectionaly political. This in many ways is only a small movement but it highlights the configuring leverage, flex-ability and wiggle room a user can request and make within an institution.Part of their default contract asked for me was to agree that my recording be published by them for promotion on multiple big tech social media platforms. I decided to test how a relational access request, one of refusing certain violent politics and infrastructures would be negotiated by this institution. To do this I asked within my access rider/requests that my recorded material boycott and not be shared on google’s platforms. I would have liked to have tried to boycott more of the big tech groups for their complicity to and enabling of many of the ongoing mass disablements and the ableist norms of efficient automation and the futures they enact. I thought to try small though and see what wiggle room this sedimented context and hardened institution had capacity for when in touch with a crip user like me. I also felt like I had more leverage to do this as they seemed to be running a little last minute, and I think I filled the “disabled voice” that lacked from the “accessible platform”. After the request things went quiet for a few days, but after a little time I got a reply and contract with this boycott formalised in writing (+@fig:google). I know this is a small gesture, and one that in many ways may have not made much change, but it opens up again to demonstrate the capacity intersection crip access riders and their requests have within configuring practice, both politically, relationally and materially. In this small gesture is the promise that access as a disobedient request can make institutions wiggle, make space, and be in dialogue with relational understandings of access.<br><img alt=\"A screen shot from a contract between me and Tate displaying a &quot;Note&quot; disclaiming it cannot be shared on platforms run by Google LLC\" src=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_media/google-excemption.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:google}These inquiries into configure-able methods and configuring access aim to give an insight into how crip studies and access-knowledge can reconfigure configuration. They have set a basis to rethink how the boundary between user/designer, requester/provider and body/institution are delineated. In the de-sedimentation of delineation it moves us from a need to cure the other or invalidate the frictions felt from boundaries but instead care for how we can oriented towards and make room for access to transform the sedimented inflexibility of institutions. These methods orients to groups in context collectively feeling out material relations and caring for their limits in a way that generates unknowable possibilities. Each action of access an affirmation of life, each affirmation a promise of a crip future to come. <br>\"It would be so cool, and you’d make me and my friends and many others very happy, and you’d increase the attendance of your events by a lot, and you’d become a working part of building the kind of world that needs to be built, if you would follow this document not just for me, but for all your work in the future.\" (Hedva, 2019)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Inquiring into access as configuration","level":3,"id":"Inquiring_into_access_as_configuration_0"},{"heading":"Collective Access-Knowledge as Configuration","level":4,"id":"Collective_Access-Knowledge_as_Configuration_0"},{"heading":"Requesting Access as Configuration","level":4,"id":"Requesting_Access_as_Configuration_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html",".html","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["05_configure-able_methods/05_media/google-excemption.html"],"createdTime":1756048612916,"modifiedTime":1756048612917,"sourceSize":17957,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration.md","exportPath":"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html":{"title":"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration","icon":"","description":"After returning to the crip table of critical access I want to return to the genealogy of configuration to coalesce it close, inflect it with -able and reorient it through these inquiries into configuring access. In this moving from that of the straight axis of STS and towards a crip queering of these methods. Part of this is to bring these methods in-touch with the framework of this project, but also as mentioned is to take up discourse of disability within feminist theory and configuration management, where it has been present but unmentioned. The latter move again informed by Kafer’s work discussed in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, taking up disability in discourse where it is seen but not felt. Again by cripping the axis of configuration, and disobediently orienting it towards an abundance of crip futures, I am not discrediting the great work of Suchman, but setting it to another background and in reach of figures and practices of disability that can disorient its sedimented norms. This disorienting of configuration for me is an action of the internal arch’s of this researcher’s inquiry. It is to think through how I relate to and practice organisational practices and theory through my embodied knowledge’s of crip methods and politics. It is also for crip studies to make room for me to feel how these internal ripples diffract, build up and make an impression and inflection on the path I take towards and from configuration.Here I reflect on the earlier two examples of configuration that Suchman offers up to inflect their methods of critiquing the differences between the prescribed plan and the situated actions of complex sociotechnical systems, and in this how expertise are figured to roles and distributed. The first thing that has to be noted here within her reflections of these inquiries is the absence of disabled voices, theory and experiences within this dialogues. Both clearly touch upon care systems, whether they were experimental data management systems or the actioning of metrified management of state care. Both of these case studies are well within reach of crip politics and lives. On looking throughout the paper the closest word to disability from a word search is fittingly that of “disappear” within the scentence:\n“In this sense, the method assemblage of configuration could be understood as a device for articulating the relation between the ‘insides’ of a socio-technical system and its constitutive ‘outsides’, including all of those things that disappear in the system’s figuration as an object” (Suchman 2012, 55)\nThis is not to say that Suchman is intentionally disappearing disabled bodies and their experiences from configuring practices, but that the norms of institutional logics place them as outsiders of their own discourse. With Hamraie, I could also provocatively read this as disabled practices of interdependence and embodied politics would trouble the neutrality of this STS axis too much (2017, p. 50), so are overruled to define a straight(er) line. Either reading, and the situated actions of Suchman’s definition have left disabled people un-agential and disabled within dialogues of their own life giving infrastructures. Below I take a closer reading of the two examples Suchman offers to highlight how crip politics could disorient these sedimented methods and wiggle them closer to my crip table and politics of life affirmation.With Ranjini’s analysis of the “Vision 2020” scheme, Suchman’s focus on situated actions orients those of healthcare professionals in the field. This scoping only shows how these people have to cut corners, make up figures and hack metrics to maintain care within their districts. This scoping, even though showing a clear separation between plans of state management and situated actions of care on the ground, does not make room for the people who had to be a corner that was cut. Neither does it make room to highlight the violence that was enacted to people in need of care when their district was punished for not hitting targets and so given ill funding. In the silencing of disabled experience here is the lack of a crip critique on these dynamics. <br>Here I aim to disorient these through both crip theories political relational model's expansive critique of cure narratives that Kafer offers (2013). In many ways the same methods of the medical model of disability are also implicated to those working within the infrastructure and organisation of healthcare in rural Andhra Pradesh, southern India. In Ranjini’s example the system was prescribed to be cured of problems of inefficiencies by neo-liberal efficiency logics of datafication and target hitting. This meant a few things, firstly that the problem is isolated within the health care system and secondly the “treatment” given to cure it are data figure, metrics and targets. This is apparent in Ranjini's notes, where even though acknowledged by those having to hit them as semi-impossible in relation to the resources provided and the situated material relations of people and space, those figure, metrics and targets were still the only legitimate dialogue that could be had. These organisational practices from “district meetings revealed no opportunity for health workers or supervisors to provide explanations as to why targets could not be met, or to inform the setting of more appropriate ones through”(Ibid, 54). And the efficient logics inevitably led to penal systems where “If they do not achieve targets, they are punished. [Of course], there is no reward. The reward is not being punished.”(Ranjini 2007, 113). This system’s configuration turning to a treatment of a penal reward system similar to that often used towards disabled people, from the ugly law through to the eugenic persecution of “feeble-minded” (Kafer 2013, 30–32). These penal logics also utalised by the AGI promises that I touch on in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction. These are figure to promise to emerge generalised intellignece and an ability to understand the unknown through automating these same penal logics. Through a crip understanding of the political/relational model though, these penal logics can be interpreted as disabling any relation they are introduced into. They do this by reducing the complex and nuanced relations of situated actions and embodied practices that sociotechnical systems emerge from down to a win/loose, valid/invalid equation. In doing so setting out a determinate action space and reducing the metrics of success to singular goals that are often unattainable within the material limits. The main issue my crip critique has is how these logics disables the reading of any alternative feedback or approach other than the desired unattainable goals/metrics and by default not intimate with what it is being put in touch with or impacting. Much like Ruha Benjamin’s critique of datafication of the injustice<a data-footref=\"2d\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and my own experiences of these dynamics at <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a>, these systems and their policies prioritises data over everything else. With an analysis of crip time we can also understand this as gate-keeping needs from being met until the perfect data or cure (that is unachievable) is achieved, and in the process invalidating, irradicating and curing the unsqueezable bugs, temporary errors and ugly data within the system.<br>The second example Suchman gives of Judith Gregory’s analysis of the HMO’s experimental data management system, similarly frames disabled people out of the dialogue. This is firstly through the works mapping of the different groups figured to be valid voices within the development of the data management system. Seemingly following the scoping set out by the HMO, the only valid groups are the HMO, the technical developers and the medical professionals. The closest they come to scoping in the disabled experience of care and their opinion is through the patient’s data, which is figured to be “always ready-to-hand”(Suchman 2012, 57). Echoing my own experience of being “cleen ready-to-use” for <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, this scoping misses the violence, objectification and industrialisation of care that such an efficient imaginary entails. This forceful shaping of the disabled bodies and patients into users in ready-to-use configurations painfully emanates the eugenic histories the Hamraie brings up with the flexible user (2017). This invalidation of voice and experience undermines the scoping of this configuration’s analysis, and for me begs for crip disobedient intervention. It is a place for me to refuse the expectation to be “always ready-to-hand” or \"cleen reedy-to-use\", and instead step out of line and question how I can situate plans and action from the sites of impact. In doing this giving those at greatest risk as well as benefit, access to and agency over how their infrastructures can affirm their current lives.<br>Searching for alternatives methods of configuration within Gregory’s critique of the HMO’s Suchman highlights how Grgory takes up Helen Verran’s notion of “working knowledges together”. In this notion Verran is figuring out methods to bring together indigenous people and a colonial state with very different imaginaries, capacities, practices and their knowledges into other intermediary spaces for dialogue. Gregory and Suchman highlight these indigenous land right discourses and methods as a way to think through how to disorient the power relations within plans, protocols and their negotiations. Verran’s “working knowledges together” is itself very interesting and has informed how I approach discourse and power relations within my approach to collective practices, but within the discourse of care systems it leaves me asking for a little more. This is not to say that indigenous studies is not applicable to disability discourse, it very much is in the ways that it, along with other positionalities, multiplies the crip experiences as I have mentioned in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> sections. Instead here specifically I wondered more why when they were looking outside of the medical management discourse and to disorient it, they didn’t move to critical-access or disability studies? Why not turn to Hamraie's critique of the flexible user (which wasn't written yet)? or to Sins in-valid's intersectional collective practices? Of coalition politics of disabled folks that go back decades? and of life affirming access practices and their knowledges? Here when Suchman and Gregory turn to the other outside of their western academic norms, they miss the other being directly impacted by the system they are inquiring into. With this -able inflection I aim to disorient the normative access of STS that holds in place these bodily horizons through these determined roles and invalidating relations. In doing this I not only start to practice how crip theory and its methods, politics and practices can disorient the norms, roles and divides of expertise in configuration practices, but also how it makes room for configuration to feedback from embodied collective practices, and ones that care for the sites of impact within configurations. <br>Returning to Amoore's (2020) update of configuration, we can also witness how in many ways she makes room for this distribution of roles from the axis of user/designer, STS expert/practitioner, prescriber/prescribed, to move to those of interdependent and collective narrative making from the sites of impact and through many orientations, approaches and capacities. In this though she still manages to negate disability studies as being a place to pull from, instead turning to almost every other marginalised group but disability<a data-footref=\"3d\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. When we return to her work through critical access and crip theory, we could understand partiality as capactiy, and opacity as access. This transforms partiality, to be understood as a relational materiality, where I practice within a technologies capacities by configuring them out to understand, figure out and care for their limits. It also refuses the boundary of opacity, aiming to not conflate the sedimented roles and positions of configurations, but to make room to figure out their interdependent relations and situated processes. Crip studies and critical access here provide not only another background to set these collective configuring methods from, but in doing so re-figures the approaches configuration can take towards complex sociotechnical systems and collective organisation. <br>“The datafication of injustice ... in which the hunt for more and more data is a barrier to acting on what we already know. We need something like an academic equivalent of “I said what I said!” – the catchphrase of reality TV star NeNe Leakes – for those who insist on digging deeper and deeper into the genome for scientific solutions to social problems.” (R.

In this chapter I wiggle together these research tables to make room for Configure-able methods to emerged from this research. This inquiry does feel a little like a second literature review in some places, and this is because I wanted to centre my approach from Crip studies within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> and in this chapter coalesce this with more of an accessible understanding of Feminist STS methods. To emerge this methodology I first trace a genealogy of configuration from its routes in figure and figuring (Lury et al., 2022) to that of Suchman’s definition of Configuration (2012). I then disorient it with an -able and critiques of critical access (Hamraie, 2017) and crip studies (Kafer, 2013) to question how configuration can be shaped when brought into contact with the dispersed and indeterminate practices, bodies and expertise of access in action. In reflection of my experiences configuring access for the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops I ran at NEoN I offer how critical access as a practice and method centres indeterminate localities and imperfect improvisations instead of the determined curative hard plans which forcefully shapes bodies and systems. With both Hamraie and Kafer, I question what the problem is within configurations, cripping it from isolated individualised issues to relational constraints of centralised plans. With this disorientation I also question how sedimented roles of user/designer/expert, prescribed/prescriber, or ethnographer/community can be reconfigured from the sites of impact and frictions within collective practices. 05.00_Intro<br>In Suchman’s essay (ibid.) she gives two examples both covering self-proclaimed bench mark digital infrastructure projects within health. The first inquiry around an speculative one fits all data management system for one of the largest health management organisation (HMO) in the US by Judith Gregory (2000) and the second around the government of rural Andhra Pradesh (India) and their implementation of their ‘Vision 2020’ policy, which undertook the implementation of a new health information infrastructures and documented by C. R. Ranjini (2007; 2006). I closely read into these two inquiries later in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section in this chapter, but Suchman brings them together to offer up and reflect on their misfitting between plans and actions, or in these examples the determined datafied figures and their indeterminate material backgrounds. In both examples Suchman shares that these systems inevitably fail, not because their task of creating comprehensive healthcare tools is impossible, but because of the efficient, normalising, and reductive imaginaries and politics that they were operated through. As I shared earlier in this chapter with the brief summary of configuration Suchman uses this framework to think through how the figures, metrics and imaginaries, work in action. With configuration she brings together both the ways in which “technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technical artefacts” (Suchman 2012, 48). In doing this she brings in-line how we plan, imagine and narrate things being done (often sedimented from a centralised, generalised and prescribed approach), with how it is situated through localised practises and material bodily horizons. By bringing these things in-line she aims to form configuration as a method of analysis which can making sense of the reverberations and frictions between situated knowings of systems through practise and the roles and figures which they can be reconfigured through. These two inquiries present this reverberation on each of their own system and infrastructure's bodily horizon to offer up what configuration as method is, and demonstrating how their sedimented norms can be radically disoriented through contingent practises of configuration.<br>The language I use at the end of the last paragraph is intentionally muddled with Ahmed’s from Queer Phenomenology (2006). This is not only because Ahmed’s work frames my research but also because Suchman’s configuration is also framed through Ahmed’s theories. Instead of Queer Phenomenology though, Suchman builds up from Ahmed’s figure of “the stranger”(2000). In this analysis she shares how Ahmed forms the stranger not as one who is unknown, but instead is recognised as the stranger. Much like the line that divides the family table, that I talk about closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a>, Suchman takes up Ahmed’s line of inherited delineation to show how “inside(r)s and outside(r)s” are drawn and sedimented. Suchman works with this to show how “the stranger” is formed through citing Marx’s commodity fetishism and reorients it into ‘a fetishism of figures’(Ahmed 2000, 4) that can hold the fantasy and materiality of things together in a plastic form. Suchman later in the essay follows up this figure of the stranger by asking how to trouble the divide between user/designer/expert, and the inherent division between those who can configure out systems for strangers and those how have to live by strangers' figures.<br>Working from these two examples Suchman defines configuration through a rigid STS axis. This aims to take up examples which situate the work by embedding the STS expert within the field, through interviews, shadowing practitioners and researching paperwork. In some ways being embedded here for STS still means being a stranger, as quality research is only achieved through an exterior expert collating information to figure out these configurations reverberations. Suchman would debate this, as she does in her essay with Karen Barad’s notion of “Agency”(2007)<a data-footref=\"2b\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-db15bbe36de01a91_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> where she reminds us that we are entangled within the apparatus no matter our delineation. I very much agree with this but within the framework set out with Ahmed’s table, I ask how much is in reach from these rigid STS positions? And how can I disorient configuration by making room for my communities to reverberate between our matters and how we figure them out.Especially in the context of this research, of refusing big tech complicity and figuring out other approaches to cloud computing and community infrastructures, it could be asked why not turn to a more recent example of configuring methods? It would be very logical to look to something like Louise Amoore's Cloud Ethics (2020), where the centralised role of the expert is dispersed to those in touch with each other and the infrastructures. Her methodology also aligns with mine, where these challenges are made through counter figures, of telling narratives or stories, making songs and contextualising configurations in messy localities. I instead take this step back to Suchman's configuration (2012) not just because it helps to accessibly demonstrate the genealogy of configuration, but also as she takes up disabled matters, and life-affirming infrastructures. I later go on to show in cripping configuration that both Suchman and Amoore still seem to negate and invalidate disabled voices, politics and theory within their dialogues. In the next section's inquiry I firstly offer up how practices of critical access are in themselves radical impact centred configuring practices, and ones that configuring life-affirming infrastructures. In doing this I then return to this STS axis to share the necessity of this inflection of access, and why indeed we need to centre crip politics and practices in these debates, not negate and invalidate them. <br>“As Barad reminds us, we are always already inside the worlds that we take as the objects of our actions” (Suchman 2012, 57)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fnref-1-db15bbe36de01a91_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n05.01.02.01_The STS axis<br>Configuration much like configure-able is an inflection, a changing in tone, context and approach of figure which “fixes” it into a generative materially entangled orientation. Lury et al. (ibid., 8) define configuring as a practice within complex systems design that makes room to join diverse elements into arrangement, never final even when \"stable\". It doesn’t refer to the final arrangement of components, but instead this practise of coalescing them together. Due to configuring being this process of bringing figures into action, as well as bringing the diverse elements of infrastructure together, it has been taken up by Science Technology Studies (STS) as a cornerstone critical methodology and mode of analysis. Lury et al.&nbsp;here points to Lucy Suchman’s definition of Configuration to demonstrate how this methodology can make room to inquire with “[a]t once action and effect”(2012, 49). Suchman’s definition makes room to understand how the stories that are told and the figures that are held in place produce specific sedimented practices of ordering. In configuration as method she makes room for a mode of analysis that can be an un/remaking through material practises and their knowledges. Lury et al.&nbsp;go on to trace configuration through the work of D. N. Rodowick (2001), Michel Foucault’s notion of similitude(2020), as well as Donna Haraway’s “string figures”(1997) and her Cyborg Manifesto (1985), which I touch on more in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. These movements by Lury et al.&nbsp;in many ways orients towards their understanding of Elizabeth Povinelli (2016) and Michelle Murphy (2017) work as practices of forming figures “equal to contemporary political configurations”(Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 10). Configure-Able Methods as I will go on to offer up, moves with these approaches of forming counter figures, but also (un)fixes these practices through impact centred design methods of critical access. Here making room to form wiggle room through these counter figures to disorient configurations from their sites of impact and friction.<br>To understand the importance of the (un)fixing and disorientation of -able further I am going to return to Suchman’s definition in her Configuration essay (2012) that Lury et al.&nbsp;touches on. This deeper reading of Suchman’s Configuration is due to it making room for me to understand why and how my research finds the need to disorient configuration through impact centred critical access methods and my disobedient methods. In doing this I am not aiming to de-legitimise this field, or Suchman's work, but to dance with them and to trouble the sedmineted norms they emerge from. In fact Suchman is taken up here as a refined version of STS, and an axis of STS for which I can disobediently crip and disorient configuration from. The other key reason for choosing Suchman’s definition is that in this essay she takes up medical infrastructures and with them the infrastructures of disability. Much like Alison Kafer’s taking up of disability within Haraway’s cyborg, which I discuss in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. I am taking up a definition of configuration where disability is in the background but not yet made known or brought in reach of the research. Here I am making wiggle room within these STS methods for the disabled figure to emerge and with them disobediently bringing their crip politics, methods, practices and approaches.05.01.02.00_Configuration<br>Like much of the work I am engaged with, Configure-able methods are an attempt to enact methods, practices and their terms so that they can be accessible to and improvised by different positions. The term configure-able, for me gives an initial proposition of disorientation, some sort of re-figuring of configurations through a crip critique of critical access, but also room to configure configurations. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> I already covered in great depth my understanding of the background of crip studies and its hacking practices and abilities within technoscience as well as my experiences of disability that informs this understanding in both <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.00_The_Crip_Table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.00_The_Crip_Table</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> sections. This definition here then focuses on the pre-intonation of configure before the -able, the orientation before the turn, inflection or retreat. Here I come to this table of configuration, approaching it from this prior one of disability, and in doing so coalesce it closer. In this dance I follow its roots as figures in motion, and so (hopefully) an accessible definition of figures and configuration as an axis that I can inflect and coalesce with critical access and crip theory in the build up to the later <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section. 05.01.00_Figuring out a Genealogy of ConfigurationTo define figure, I start by working closely with Celia Lury et. al's already fairly accessible definition (2022). In the intro chapter to their Figure Concept and Method book they define two propositions of figure, one as a noun and one as a verb. The difference in the two is key, as I will share, as it takes us from passive and inherited determined figures, and stories of a world, to being able to figure out our own stories and relations with each other and technologies.<br>To define figure as a noun, they first build up from Erich Auerbach’s (2013) tracing of its etymology within “Figura” in Latin. Figura developed from a constellation of technical Greek words that orient the materiality of things and plays between plasticity and form within their shaping. Auerbach raises the tension within Figura which came about to think through this delineation of both the material and conceptual elements of an object. In a sense this meant that within western discourse Figura, or later figures, became a place to pivot or orient our understanding of the material through the conceptual. Figures are sedimented into christian doctrine, where stained in glass they can be understood as a way of forming futures from pasts<a data-footref=\"1a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-965cf4cc5550a654_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, making prophesy from historic fables. Quoting Hayden White, Lury et al.&nbsp;states that the use of figures to represent this exchange is “Western culture’s unique achievement of identifying reality as history”(1999, 96). In this motion of prefiguring, Auerbach understands a flow of figuring that deterministically moves into set configurations of material practices and the limited scoping of their possibility.When brought into the fields of social and political studies Figures are used in multiple ways. Lury et al. highlights Norbert Elias (1987) as a sociologist who focuses on the relationality and interdependence of persons and the ways this can figure their configuration. In his work he states it is the role of a social scientist to understand how these configurations bind them to their subject another (ibid., 79). This understanding of figures as relational practices forms the base for figurational sociology. In these figurational practices we start to understand that figures are not determined prototypes, but act as stories in motion, plastic and performable. Lury runs through a few of these performances of figures in relation, moving from an isolated and disinterested flâneur by Charles Baudelaire through to Walter Benjamin’s crowd (2003). In doing this she not only shares the plasticity of the figure, but also how in their relationality they are lived through.<br>The final critique Lury et al. (2022, 4) make of the figure as a noun is of its western context, of the list of white men referenced to manifest it here in writing. In the most part, they point out that within this relational practice of the figure is a practice of differencing and division<a data-footref=\"2a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-2-965cf4cc5550a654_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. To examine this division further they take up Alexander G. Weheliye’s critique of “racialisation” (2014) as a crucial axis. With Weheliye they question sedimented figures by moving from following what they scope to questioning how they are scoped. Through this inversion of their approach to figures it can be understood as a probing tool, one for reflecting on and feeling out our means of producing knowledge.<br>Interestingly this movement of inverting the figure to understand its maker also resonates with the move of the social model of disabilitie’s inversion of the medical model which I talk more about in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model</a> entry. In this move the social model's inversion of sedimented power relations and their practices, even though useful to understand certain aspects of power, can in some ways miss the nuance of relations. With a crip approach I look to trouble this by exploring how a figure can of course be inverted, but also what other relations and practices can I make room for when I choose to feel the frictions between figures and their backgrounds.<br>Figuring as a verb takes on the action of forming figures, of figuring things out and of composing or computing figures. within this diversity of forms and use of figure there is a focus on the tactility of thinking when we are working through them. Taken as method figuring makes room to apprehend the shape of something, of feeling out a figure, collating one together, and making wiggle room for another one to join. In this figuring out of space, much like with the noun, is this division of what is brought into being a figure and what is backgrounded to contour that figure. Lury et al. approaches this with Edgar Rubin’s psychological research into perception (1958), where his depiction of figure and ground are defined by the “contour” that runs between them. They give the example of the “Rubin vase”<a data-footref=\"3a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-3-965cf4cc5550a654_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. With Ahmed I could similarly ask what contingent approaches and practises do I rely upon, turning back to them when feeling out contours of bodily-horizons, as I have not found another path I yet desire, or another background to figure out from. This is especially true within disability studies where the figure of the crip is only just disobediently emerging into discourse of other fields, and has always been kept in the background. With my crip figuring out it is to make wiggle room around these sedimented norms for this disabled figure to be contoured among, and with it the demands of critical access and disobedient relational politics of crip theory. <br>“The Old Testament “pre- figures” the New Testament, past and future are symbiotically shaped in, and indeed incarnated by, typology: Word made flesh\" (Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 2)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fnref-1-965cf4cc5550a654_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>“the fig-ure of “man” figures who gets to be considered human by means of a series of constitutive exclusions (Mbembe 2017).

This has led me to reflect deeply on access-knowledge not only as a flexibility and capacity we build up around institutions and their norms through practice but also as one of the most divergent sites of impact to reconfigure complex systems from. By inquiring into access knowledge as configuration in practise, I aim to share how disability studies has inform my capacities for making room for the indeterminate needs and material limits of people and technologies around the sedimented norms of institutions. I have already written a lot on the many times I have encountered frictious access prepared by others and made me feel out of place, like at the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> or the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, or access that has made me feel understood and affirmed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>. Here though, I find it more pressing to share my experiences and inquiries around forming access with and for others, as well as reflecting on my requesting of access from institutions as reconfiguring practicises. Inquiring into these orientations, of both access requester towards institutions and collective provider within community work, I aim to trouble the sedimented division of user/designer/expert roles in practises of configuring access. This inquiry gives shape to configure-able methods, and how I aim to approach and care for these normalised institutional limits, forming wiggle room within and around them. In doing this though, I also aim to not so easily collapse pre-configure roles, like users, workshop participants and presenter, but instead be intimate with the intersectional capacities of those involved and how each person can orient themselves in locality together to configure collective access. To render this inquiry around Configure-Able methods I will focus on an initial attempt to meet people's access needs at a workshop I ran and which has inform the initial emergence of these methods. This was a workshop called Configure-Able Infrastructures I organised with NEoN digital. This was both my first attempt at a UKRI funded Knowledge Exchange (KE) but more importantly here, it was my first clear attempt at putting on an accessible workshop, and so has given me many misfittings, frictions and disorienting factors to reflect and learn from. These workshops were manifested as a place to explore and exchange dialogues of digital accessibility outside of big tech services, and was hosted by NEoN Digital Arts, a community based organisation focusing on digital access. I invited two groups to share their work. One was M.E.L.T. a crip digital arts collaboration of Ren Britton and Iz Paehr, presenting their Access Server work. The other person I invited was Ai Carmela from SysterServer to accessibly share technical skills of feminist network practices. These workshops in retrospect worked out okay for my first attempt at an accessible workshop, but left me quite anxious about how well I had managed it. This was in part not just because access in action is a steep learning curve when coming from the ableist norms of academic institutions and open-source community alike. From these institutions, flexibility is not asked but silently/violently demanded of the user, students, researchers or person approaching them, as our soft crip bodies and needs are stretched to fit the valid normid user's capacities and form. This being said these frictions and misfittings provide a quality example of how access-knowledge understood as configuration can be a generative tool for analysing the relations, politics, norms and imaginaries holding the current configurations of systems in place and which don't let them contextually flex to the soft bodies or needs they come in touch with in context.The focus of this inquiry is to reflect on the demands for bodies to be flexible by both academic and open-source institutional inflexibility in action. I also focus on the response to institutional inflexibility and the room for flexibility within the constellation of producers and presenters running the workshop. In this I aim to demonstrate how institutional norms reinforce roles of user/designer, prescribed/prescriber, where as communities actioned through forms of critical access can make wiggle room within how they contextualising their roles and relations beyond what is sedimented as inflexible. I will begin by orienting towards the workshops use of Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). I as an organiser had decided to try to run the workshop using FLOSS platforms and services hosted by different communities. This was mainly out of curiosity of what access was possible within FLOSS, but also to attempt a refusal to flex to the ableist norms of academia and big tech. The friction we had here originated from M.E.L.T. but reverberated among us, and came about due to this being an online workshop where we wanted to provide people with captions to access the workshops. The budget for this KE event was limited, so I oriented towards using auto-captions, and paying the presenters what I could. In trying to configure out a FLOSS video call with auto-captioning, I realised that this just did not exist (within reach). Default installs of Jiitsi did not have it, and even though there was some documentation on how to do it, I had not found an instance of it. With Big Blue Button (BBB) it had room for manual captioning but no wiggle room to automate it. This absence was overpowering in some ways, and showed how the Ableist norms of FLOSS did not centre accessibility or find it central to its future development. Access is very much was extra time for FLOSS. It also surfaces that if we want to be flexible to people's access needs we have to all flex to the inflexible politics, relations and protocols of big tech as the \"one best way\". Here though we refused their inflexibility and instead oriented towards forming access around FLOSS and away from big tech. To do this I providing a detailed “how to” for setting up a captioning system on a local machine. This sharing of knowledge and improvising of infrastructure made wiggle room for flexibility around how people improvise configurations of access-able alternatives to complicit big tech platforms. It also shares how through collaborative action we both felt design frictions, but made room to bridge that gap, improvise and flex the hard machines to wiggle some room within these misfittings for one afternoon. From this friction also came a generative conversation with Sabrina at NeoN, talking about auto-captioning compared to live captioning by a professional person or sonographer. We talked about how live-captioning by a person is not only more accurate but is itself a practice and an art form where they can add in more context but also creativity in the way they represent the dynamics and relations of what is being said. Here I did not want to replace the people who practice these vibrant and generative art forms, professions, and practitioners knowledges with clumsy and uniformed automation. When I think through access oriented like this, and as centring art and creaivity it again transforms the narrative of access from one of a burden and constraint, to one of joy and pleasure. In Lousie Hickman's video essay Crip AI (2021), she takes this into even closer detail to question how these histories of crip centred practices of sonographers are being overuled and left out of the dialogue when automating their practices and creative captions. Hamraie also shares how this is something of a norm when industrial design models approach disability, or even across fields. This is where these approaches do not navigate the methods, context or history of a field but just bluntly apply their own one best way of efficient design to it. With crip theory this unquestioned and prescribed move to the automation of access can also be understood as being more about relational politics which forcefully isolating disabled people by investing in ways to reduce funds for creative and intimate human centred practices of access-knowledge, care and joy within disabled lives. This isn't to say we shouldn't invest in their development, or to exclude the disabled people that might prefer these technologies to a person, but it is to make space for the option. It is like Hickman's Crip AI, which lays down the terms of if this is happening to us, we are making room in it to bring are backgrounds with us.Being honest in these workshops it was a mix of institutional inflexibility from KE funds to not support this type of access by default but also my unknowing of how to access more funds that led me to improvise this automated access. Here though instead of have the capacity to make room for better access and the captioning as art and joy full, we did manifest ways to form automated access without being entangled in the complicit \"one best way\" of big tech. With this I aim to demonstrate how these access frictions not only formed a generative place for us to locally and collectively analyse the configuration of automated creative captions and FLOSS, but also materially configure our own improvised alternatives then and there.From another orientation emerged a second friction from this workshop, with just as much inflexibility but this time coming from the academic institution. This friction came from the simple action of getting funds to pay individuals that had already been awarded to me to run from UKRI through the KE scheme. This fairly simple task became inaccessible to me, not because the money was not declared, but because the process itself was not clear or accessible, leaving me un-agential and unable to do this simple task. The background to this moment is that efficiently my departments admin team had been fired and they had hired new people but not trained them. In doing so made the practices they were hired to do inaccessible to both them and to requesting staff like me. In my context this meant spending months emailing back and forth with these admin \"experts\" trying to get them to pay the participants the money that was allocated for them. The lack of access here was shown in how I, as an early career researcher doing these things for the first time did not know exactly what to tell the admin person. In the opposite direction as a un-trained administrator, nor could they guide me to the right forms and process. In full there was no flex-ability for us to meet in the middle (even with a slight gap).I ended up resolving this by reaching out to my supervisor, who advised me on emailing another experienced admin who was more experienced and flexible. They managed to get the payments for participants sorted in one afternoon, slightly less that three months. Even still here there were complexities with getting some people paid due to state regulations. This shows how this configuration of knowledge exchange by academic institutions and their funding bodies like UKRI only make room for certain imagined bodies or normid users to be present and felt, those that know who to ask, and what form to fill in already, no matter those let on the campus or in the state. In this inflexibility these institutions making certain other sorts of research by those not used to these sedimented processes slow to almost static. In this case here, if a person needed help accessing the administrational logics of these institutions or sit in the grey areas of state regulations you are waylaid and invalidated from sharing your knowledge, experience and practices in this ecology, or at least getting paid to do so. This systemic institutional invalidation, hiding and silencing of certain bodies and experiences is well known, but what I highlight here is that it was again us as a group who made room for and improvised a local flexible collective access within this institutional background so that it could come into contact with and be reoriented by these radical access frictions and their generative knowledges.<br>Moving on from the frictions within the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops, I now move to trouble the role of requesting access from institutions through relational and political crip demands and the room that makes for reconfiguration. Here I am reflecting on the calls for friction in the Crip Tehcnoscience Maifesto (Hamraie &amp; Fritsch, 2019), of making direct actions of access, of cutting curbs in barriers, politics and sociotechnical relations. Here though I want to share how requesting access to institutions on these crip terms can create wiggle room and flexibility in these hard systems not only the individuals life of the requester, but those in a wide scope of crip intersectional politics and struggle. This sees access as community leverage and interdependent resistance using these systems to enable refusal of certain politics but also most importantly care for other orientations. Hamraie and Fritsch's examples present direct action towards normalised ableist public infrastructure, but here I wiggled room into an access request I made to an institution that brought in these intersectional crip politics. This maybe aligns more with what Britton writes in On Rehearsing Access (Britton, 2024), and quoting Hedva's Access Rider<a data-footref=\"1m\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-587c53b49fff211a_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, where they ask what real and permanent change their demands of access can make to institutions. The request I am reflecting on here is when I produced an audio piece for Tate’s electric dream FM on crip big-tech disobedience, where I talked about fermenting foods and feelings as a crip erotic technology. This was their accessible audio exhibition that accompanied the Electric Dreams retrospective, which presented an impressive catalogue of arts at the intersection of science and technology before the internet. Here in this extra time around the exhibition for access, I used this platform to not only highlight crip erotics of care, embodied practice and disobedient relational refusal, but most importantly here, test what access as a request can enable when thought understood as intersectionaly political. This in many ways is only a small movement but it highlights the configuring leverage, flex-ability and wiggle room a user can request and make within an institution.Part of their default contract asked for me was to agree that my recording be published by them for promotion on multiple big tech social media platforms. I decided to test how a relational access request, one of refusing certain violent politics and infrastructures would be negotiated by this institution. To do this I asked within my access rider/requests that my recorded material boycott and not be shared on google’s platforms. I would have liked to have tried to boycott more of the big tech groups for their complicity to and enabling of many of the ongoing mass disablements and the ableist norms of efficient automation and the futures they enact. I thought to try small though and see what wiggle room this sedimented context and hardened institution had capacity for when in touch with a crip user like me. I also felt like I had more leverage to do this as they seemed to be running a little last minute, and I think I filled the “disabled voice” that lacked from the “accessible platform”. After the request things went quiet for a few days, but after a little time I got a reply and contract with this boycott formalised in writing (+@fig:google). I know this is a small gesture, and one that in many ways may have not made much change, but it opens up again to demonstrate the capacity intersection crip access riders and their requests have within configuring practice, both politically, relationally and materially. In this small gesture is the promise that access as a disobedient request can make institutions wiggle, make space, and be in dialogue with relational understandings of access.<br><img alt=\"A screen shot from a contract between me and Tate displaying a &quot;Note&quot; disclaiming it cannot be shared on platforms run by Google LLC\" src=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_media/google-excemption.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:google}These inquiries into configure-able methods and configuring access aim to give an insight into how crip studies and access-knowledge can reconfigure configuration.

In the de-sedimentation of delineation it moves us from a need to cure the other or invalidate the frictions felt from boundaries but instead care for how we can oriented towards and make room for access to transform the sedimented inflexibility of institutions. These methods orients to groups in context collectively feeling out material relations and caring for their limits in a way that generates unknowable possibilities.

Part of this is to bring these methods in-touch with the framework of this project, but also as mentioned is to take up discourse of disability within feminist theory and configuration management, where it has been present but unmentioned. The latter move again informed by Kafer’s work discussed in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, taking up disability in discourse where it is seen but not felt. Again by cripping the axis of configuration, and disobediently orienting it towards an abundance of crip futures, I am not discrediting the great work of Suchman, but setting it to another background and in reach of figures and practices of disability that can disorient its sedimented norms. This disorienting of configuration for me is an action of the internal arch’s of this researcher’s inquiry. It is to think through how I relate to and practice organisational practices and theory through my embodied knowledge’s of crip methods and politics. It is also for crip studies to make room for me to feel how these internal ripples diffract, build up and make an impression and inflection on the path I take towards and from configuration.Here I reflect on the earlier two examples of configuration that Suchman offers up to inflect their methods of critiquing the differences between the prescribed plan and the situated actions of complex sociotechnical systems, and in this how expertise are figured to roles and distributed. The first thing that has to be noted here within her reflections of these inquiries is the absence of disabled voices, theory and experiences within this dialogues. Both clearly touch upon care systems, whether they were experimental data management systems or the actioning of metrified management of state care. Both of these case studies are well within reach of crip politics and lives. On looking throughout the paper the closest word to disability from a word search is fittingly that of “disappear” within the scentence:\n“In this sense, the method assemblage of configuration could be understood as a device for articulating the relation between the ‘insides’ of a socio-technical system and its constitutive ‘outsides’, including all of those things that disappear in the system’s figuration as an object” (Suchman 2012, 55)\nThis is not to say that Suchman is intentionally disappearing disabled bodies and their experiences from configuring practices, but that the norms of institutional logics place them as outsiders of their own discourse. With Hamraie, I could also provocatively read this as disabled practices of interdependence and embodied politics would trouble the neutrality of this STS axis too much (2017, p. 50), so are overruled to define a straight(er) line. Either reading, and the situated actions of Suchman’s definition have left disabled people un-agential and disabled within dialogues of their own life giving infrastructures. Below I take a closer reading of the two examples Suchman offers to highlight how crip politics could disorient these sedimented methods and wiggle them closer to my crip table and politics of life affirmation.With Ranjini’s analysis of the “Vision 2020” scheme, Suchman’s focus on situated actions orients those of healthcare professionals in the field. This scoping only shows how these people have to cut corners, make up figures and hack metrics to maintain care within their districts. This scoping, even though showing a clear separation between plans of state management and situated actions of care on the ground, does not make room for the people who had to be a corner that was cut. Neither does it make room to highlight the violence that was enacted to people in need of care when their district was punished for not hitting targets and so given ill funding. In the silencing of disabled experience here is the lack of a crip critique on these dynamics. <br>Here I aim to disorient these through both crip theories political relational model's expansive critique of cure narratives that Kafer offers (2013). In many ways the same methods of the medical model of disability are also implicated to those working within the infrastructure and organisation of healthcare in rural Andhra Pradesh, southern India. In Ranjini’s example the system was prescribed to be cured of problems of inefficiencies by neo-liberal efficiency logics of datafication and target hitting. This meant a few things, firstly that the problem is isolated within the health care system and secondly the “treatment” given to cure it are data figure, metrics and targets. This is apparent in Ranjini's notes, where even though acknowledged by those having to hit them as semi-impossible in relation to the resources provided and the situated material relations of people and space, those figure, metrics and targets were still the only legitimate dialogue that could be had. These organisational practices from “district meetings revealed no opportunity for health workers or supervisors to provide explanations as to why targets could not be met, or to inform the setting of more appropriate ones through”(Ibid, 54). And the efficient logics inevitably led to penal systems where “If they do not achieve targets, they are punished. [Of course], there is no reward. The reward is not being punished.”(Ranjini 2007, 113). This system’s configuration turning to a treatment of a penal reward system similar to that often used towards disabled people, from the ugly law through to the eugenic persecution of “feeble-minded” (Kafer 2013, 30–32). These penal logics also utalised by the AGI promises that I touch on in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction. These are figure to promise to emerge generalised intellignece and an ability to understand the unknown through automating these same penal logics. Through a crip understanding of the political/relational model though, these penal logics can be interpreted as disabling any relation they are introduced into. They do this by reducing the complex and nuanced relations of situated actions and embodied practices that sociotechnical systems emerge from down to a win/loose, valid/invalid equation. In doing so setting out a determinate action space and reducing the metrics of success to singular goals that are often unattainable within the material limits. The main issue my crip critique has is how these logics disables the reading of any alternative feedback or approach other than the desired unattainable goals/metrics and by default not intimate with what it is being put in touch with or impacting. Much like Ruha Benjamin’s critique of datafication of the injustice<a data-footref=\"2d\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-e4f17fc7f671f90e_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and my own experiences of these dynamics at <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a>, these systems and their policies prioritises data over everything else. With an analysis of crip time we can also understand this as gate-keeping needs from being met until the perfect data or cure (that is unachievable) is achieved, and in the process invalidating, irradicating and curing the unsqueezable bugs, temporary errors and ugly data within the system.<br>The second example Suchman gives of Judith Gregory’s analysis of the HMO’s experimental data management system, similarly frames disabled people out of the dialogue. This is firstly through the works mapping of the different groups figured to be valid voices within the development of the data management system. Seemingly following the scoping set out by the HMO, the only valid groups are the HMO, the technical developers and the medical professionals. The closest they come to scoping in the disabled experience of care and their opinion is through the patient’s data, which is figured to be “always ready-to-hand”(Suchman 2012, 57). Echoing my own experience of being “cleen ready-to-use” for <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, this scoping misses the violence, objectification and industrialisation of care that such an efficient imaginary entails. This forceful shaping of the disabled bodies and patients into users in ready-to-use configurations painfully emanates the eugenic histories the Hamraie brings up with the flexible user (2017). This invalidation of voice and experience undermines the scoping of this configuration’s analysis, and for me begs for crip disobedient intervention. It is a place for me to refuse the expectation to be “always ready-to-hand” or \"cleen reedy-to-use\", and instead step out of line and question how I can situate plans and action from the sites of impact. In doing this giving those at greatest risk as well as benefit, access to and agency over how their infrastructures can affirm their current lives.<br>Searching for alternatives methods of configuration within Gregory’s critique of the HMO’s Suchman highlights how Grgory takes up Helen Verran’s notion of “working knowledges together”. In this notion Verran is figuring out methods to bring together indigenous people and a colonial state with very different imaginaries, capacities, practices and their knowledges into other intermediary spaces for dialogue. Gregory and Suchman highlight these indigenous land right discourses and methods as a way to think through how to disorient the power relations within plans, protocols and their negotiations. Verran’s “working knowledges together” is itself very interesting and has informed how I approach discourse and power relations within my approach to collective practices, but within the discourse of care systems it leaves me asking for a little more. This is not to say that indigenous studies is not applicable to disability discourse, it very much is in the ways that it, along with other positionalities, multiplies the crip experiences as I have mentioned in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.03_Crip_intersectionality</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> sections. Instead here specifically I wondered more why when they were looking outside of the medical management discourse and to disorient it, they didn’t move to critical-access or disability studies? Why not turn to Hamraie's critique of the flexible user (which wasn't written yet)? or to Sins in-valid's intersectional collective practices? Of coalition politics of disabled folks that go back decades? and of life affirming access practices and their knowledges? Here when Suchman and Gregory turn to the other outside of their western academic norms, they miss the other being directly impacted by the system they are inquiring into. With this -able inflection I aim to disorient the normative access of STS that holds in place these bodily horizons through these determined roles and invalidating relations. In doing this I not only start to practice how crip theory and its methods, politics and practices can disorient the norms, roles and divides of expertise in configuration practices, but also how it makes room for configuration to feedback from embodied collective practices, and ones that care for the sites of impact within configurations. <br>Returning to Amoore's (2020) update of configuration, we can also witness how in many ways she makes room for this distribution of roles from the axis of user/designer, STS expert/practitioner, prescriber/prescribed, to move to those of interdependent and collective narrative making from the sites of impact and through many orientations, approaches and capacities. In this though she still manages to negate disability studies as being a place to pull from, instead turning to almost every other marginalised group but disability<a data-footref=\"3d\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-2-e4f17fc7f671f90e_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. When we return to her work through critical access and crip theory, we could understand partiality as capactiy, and opacity as access. This transforms partiality, to be understood as a relational materiality, where I practice within a technologies capacities by configuring them out to understand, figure out and care for their limits. It also refuses the boundary of opacity, aiming to not conflate the sedimented roles and positions of configurations, but to make room to figure out their interdependent relations and situated processes. Crip studies and critical access here provide not only another background to set these collective configuring methods from, but in doing so re-figures the approaches configuration can take towards complex sociotechnical systems and collective organisation. <br>“The datafication of injustice ... in which the hunt for more and more data is a barrier to acting on what we already know. We need something like an academic equivalent of “I said what I said!” – the catchphrase of reality TV star NeNe Leakes – for those who insist on digging deeper and deeper into the genome for scientific solutions to social problems.” (R. Benjamin 2020, 117)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fnref-1-e4f17fc7f671f90e_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"It seems that the struggles of our contemporary moment — resisting the rise of far-right nationalist groups, racist doctrines of anti- immigration, the everyday violences of sexism, racism, and bigotry — confront also the profound difficulties of finding an opening at the limit of the frame.

To do this I aim to translate the inflection of access-able to to that of configure-able through a tracing of access-knowledge and critical access. With this disorientating inflection I aim to inform the STS methods of configuration through those of Aimi Hamraie's tracing of flexible users (2017) and their understanding of access-knowledge. To do this I take into focus my own experiences of organising access for others as well as requesting access myself as inquiries into configuring practices informed through access-knowledge.<br>To start this inquiry into critical access it is interesting to first turn to -able as a suffix or as what I am calling here an inflection. -able or -ible’s etymology is traced from middle English, that comes from a French incursion of “-able”, and an empirical root in Latin with “-abilis”. This suffix’s etymology inflects “-able” to orient towards that of being able to do something, to enter, to be free from constraint or even gifted, but more specifically worthy of doing that thing or of being free. This sedimented line of “-able” being about worth is one that we still feel to this date, where questions of disabled people being worthy of access to basic care and a standard quality of life is still seemingly an open debate in the uk <a data-footref=\"41\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able-methods_canvas.html#fn-1-8bac924d7d740070_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Instead here, I orient to take a step back and disobediently retreat from these normative terms of -able and think through how critical access and crip studies might disorient it otherwise. Interestingly on the retreat we may pass the Old English suffix of “-endlic” that “-able” straightened out and overruled. “-endlic” instead of focusing on the value or worthiness of the subject, focuses on the material capacity. Inflecting a word with it means it is capable to, or able to do something. Why I stop here to catch a breath on the retreat is because it denotes a key aspect of critical access that I want to highlight. It is not about a person being worthy of access, but it is to orient access as a collective flexibility to do what we can materially, and to be honest and open about those flex-abilities, capacities and contours. Kafer poses an understanding of flexibility as \"not just extra time\" (2013, p.27) for disabled people, where \"rather than bend disabled bodies and minds to meet the clock, crip time bends the clock to meet disabled bodies and mind\"(ibid, p.27). This is similarly reflected on by Aimi Hamraie's tracing of the flexible user and the human factor (2017) within eugenics, industrial engineering and ergonomics beginning in the nineteenth century. The flexible \"user\" traced by Hamraie emerges from mass prosthetic manufacture after the world wars and poses soft human bodies, and the emergent human factor they make up within systems design, to be malleable problems to be cured by being shape by and for hard normalising systems and their processes. This in contemporary critiques is highlighted in the work of Renyi Hong's \"plasticity\" (2024), but especially in his critique of curative platforms (2024). This is where big tech platforms, like \"Grab, a leading superapp platform in Southeast Asia\", form narratives of disabled bodies as empowered by flexible work within a system and making room for them to choose when to work. In action thought this resulted pushing people with disabilities into precarious work and unsafe working environments, which never resulted in them having stability, agency or being empowered. It forced them to be flexible to the clock and processes of the app, and did not make room for or imagine their indeterminate bodies or their wider relational frictions.In response to these design politics Hamraie offers up the history of access-knowledge and of disabled people as knowers and makers to disorient hard machines to be flexible to softer bodies and build up the capacities within them for indeterminate crip bodies and their situated horizons. When we orient to how crip studies is practised around access in academia (Abrams, Floyd, and Abes 2024; Evans et al. 2024), and also from my own experiences of providing it, it is this place where we question the flexibility of the sedimented hard relations and politics of institutions, from the ways they conform disabled bodies within times, categories and metric figures, to how these invalidating practices validate and bring peoples needs into dialogue.\n“The disability to come . . . will and should always belong to the time of the promise. . . . it’s a crip promise that we will always comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively, somehow access other worlds and futures.”\n—Robert McRuer, Crip Theor (McRuer and Bérubé 2006)\nIn the appendices of Feminist queer and crip Kafer (2013, 171–78) quotes McRuer above, before sharing her own materials from her practises of access. In this quote and in Kafer’s placement of it I interpret this “crip promise” that opens up crip futures as a promise of access that we make to ourselves and others around us. This promise of access for me is a call for life affirmation. It is a disorienting and inflecting action that moves towards affirming lives through emergent daily practices of access. By orienting life-affirmation on indeterminate access I don’t aim to determine what it is or can be, but aim to configure out the practices that can make room for life affirmation to be know-able through access in action. Stating access as a promise orients not as a static set of “universal” solutions or cures, such as the historic \"one best way\" (2017, p. 61) that Hamraie critiques. In this practise I know this is not something I can master or cure and there will never be a determinate \"one bast way\" or a solution to access. As Hamraie's forms it access-knowledge is produced through \"Flexible knowing (knowledge of a range of embodiments) and flexible design (designing for those embodiments)\", that form needs and access outcomes from situated bodies and not generalised or prescribed normid bodies. Hamraie shares the histories of access knowledge through the reverberation of section 504, and where barrier free access started to come into equality laws. In this recollection they share the many misfitting, iterations and localisations of these laws, as disable activists tried to make room in the generalised state and international level access laws for the situated diverse needs of the people with disability within America. These range form the ways mandatory policies were made advisories when taken to other states (turned into extra time), how barrier free access was scoped towards more traditionally socially visible disabilities, and how institutionalised barrier free access also pushed for circulation and visibility of disabled people, instead of giving them agency over their lives.<br>This troubling and reverberating of the rulers line through access-knowledge itself comes to a position of validating the collective labours, the possibility of institutional flexibility and the situated knowledges that it takes to be in a place or relation together. Bringing this back to Kafer, she demonstrates her access-knowledge through practise of making scent free spaces, and where the expanded relational understanding of access it undertakes is explicit. This is where all participant must be intimate with this room, considerate about what they clean themselves with and how they can stay chemical free until they reach this room. With Johanna Hedva’s Sick Woman Theory (2016) they also think through the ways access-knowledge troubles the normative roles of activism, and asks how can their be more room for expressions from those who cannot always be there in person due to illness, capacities or other life commitments. Hedva here transforms the understanding of what it is we can offer when we show up for justice. Another recollection of the many contexts of access-knowledge in action is Ren Britton's On Rehearsing Access (Britton, 2024) where access riders and their request are taken up as hacking tools to make room and flexibility in communities and institutions so disabled people can thrive within them. These patterns and practices of access knowledge differ greatly from a model of centralised control seen not only in the medical model, but also politics of neo-liberal austerity and their efficiency policies and imaginaries of sociopolitical infrastructures. In Suchman’s examples as I go on to share in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, some of my own in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a>, as well as Ahmed and Kafer’s work that i discuss in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a>, we have offered up how the pivotal action in centralised control is a holding of a determined line in place through invalidating penal logics, which almost always negate and silence the material relations, sense making and feedback of bodies. Understanding access knowledge as a promise of flexibility instead of a checklist (Kafer 2017), approaches it as an ongoing process of situated negotiation and a radical space of flexing lines and wiggling room for crip folks to participate how they feel able and desire to. This indeterminate promise and practice of access knowledge in action can seem overwhelming in the way that it is non-prescriptive, in need of deep intimacy and care as well as often admitting to not really have the capacity to meet the full needs of people. Saying this though I have been finding comfort in returning to this -endlic inflection of -ability, turning it from worth and towards capacity. Access in these terms takes so many paths converging and diverging between communities and institutions at each situated and messy locality, lines being drawn and woven together to configure a holey tapestry. The spaces missed and gaps out of reach of our communities thread giving form and horizon to this body, forming contours around what access is and can be. Here I am inquiring into how I approach my capacities when configuring access through a critical flexibility that aims to go between these divergent points, become intimate with the lines that divides the expertise within my communities and orient to practices of going into the unknown together. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\"

05_Configure-able methods_canvas05.00_IntroThis chapter covers the initial inquiry of my research, and the coalescing together of crip theory and critical access with that of Feminist Science and Technologies Studies (STS). In this chapter I wiggle together these research tables to make room for Configure-able methods to emerged from this research. This inquiry does feel a little like a second literature review in some places, and this is because I wanted to centre my approach from Crip studies within <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> and in this chapter coalesce this with more of an accessible understanding of Feminist STS methods. To emerge this methodology I first trace a genealogy of configuration from its routes in figure and figuring (Lury et al., 2022) to that of Suchman’s definition of Configuration (2012). I then disorient it with an -able and critiques of critical access (Hamraie, 2017) and crip studies (Kafer, 2013) to question how configuration can be shaped when brought into contact with the dispersed and indeterminate practices, bodies and expertise of access in action. In reflection of my experiences configuring access for the Configure-Able Infrastructures workshops I ran at NEoN I offer how critical access as a practice and method centres indeterminate localities and imperfect improvisations instead of the determined curative hard plans which forcefully shapes bodies and systems. With both Hamraie and Kafer, I question what the problem is within configurations, cripping it from isolated individualised issues to relational constraints of centralised plans. With this disorientation I also question how sedimented roles of user/designer/expert, prescribed/prescriber, or ethnographer/community can be reconfigured from the sites of impact and frictions within collective practices. 05.01.00_Figuring out a Genealogy of Configuration<br>Like much of the work I am engaged with, Configure-able methods are an attempt to enact methods, practices and their terms so that they can be accessible to and improvised by different positions. The term configure-able, for me gives an initial proposition of disorientation, some sort of re-figuring of configurations through a crip critique of critical access, but also room to configure configurations. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a> I already covered in great depth my understanding of the background of crip studies and its hacking practices and abilities within technoscience as well as my experiences of disability that informs this understanding in both <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.00_The_Crip_Table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.00_The_Crip_Table</a> and <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> sections. This definition here then focuses on the pre-intonation of configure before the -able, the orientation before the turn, inflection or retreat. Here I come to this table of configuration, approaching it from this prior one of disability, and in doing so coalesce it closer. In this dance I follow its roots as figures in motion, and so (hopefully) an accessible definition of figures and configuration as an axis that I can inflect and coalesce with critical access and crip theory in the build up to the later <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section. 05.01.01.00_FigureTo define figure, I start by working closely with Celia Lury et. al's already fairly accessible definition (2022). In the intro chapter to their Figure Concept and Method book they define two propositions of figure, one as a noun and one as a verb. The difference in the two is key, as I will share, as it takes us from passive and inherited determined figures, and stories of a world, to being able to figure out our own stories and relations with each other and technologies.<br>To define figure as a noun, they first build up from Erich Auerbach’s (2013) tracing of its etymology within “Figura” in Latin. Figura developed from a constellation of technical Greek words that orient the materiality of things and plays between plasticity and form within their shaping. Auerbach raises the tension within Figura which came about to think through this delineation of both the material and conceptual elements of an object. In a sense this meant that within western discourse Figura, or later figures, became a place to pivot or orient our understanding of the material through the conceptual. Figures are sedimented into christian doctrine, where stained in glass they can be understood as a way of forming futures from pasts<a data-footref=\"1a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-df6893fbe5f10211_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, making prophesy from historic fables. Quoting Hayden White, Lury et al.&nbsp;states that the use of figures to represent this exchange is “Western culture’s unique achievement of identifying reality as history”(1999, 96). In this motion of prefiguring, Auerbach understands a flow of figuring that deterministically moves into set configurations of material practices and the limited scoping of their possibility.When brought into the fields of social and political studies Figures are used in multiple ways. Lury et al. highlights Norbert Elias (1987) as a sociologist who focuses on the relationality and interdependence of persons and the ways this can figure their configuration. In his work he states it is the role of a social scientist to understand how these configurations bind them to their subject another (ibid., 79). This understanding of figures as relational practices forms the base for figurational sociology. In these figurational practices we start to understand that figures are not determined prototypes, but act as stories in motion, plastic and performable. Lury runs through a few of these performances of figures in relation, moving from an isolated and disinterested flâneur by Charles Baudelaire through to Walter Benjamin’s crowd (2003). In doing this she not only shares the plasticity of the figure, but also how in their relationality they are lived through.<br>The final critique Lury et al. (2022, 4) make of the figure as a noun is of its western context, of the list of white men referenced to manifest it here in writing. In the most part, they point out that within this relational practice of the figure is a practice of differencing and division<a data-footref=\"2a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-df6893fbe5f10211_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. To examine this division further they take up Alexander G. Weheliye’s critique of “racialisation” (2014) as a crucial axis. With Weheliye they question sedimented figures by moving from following what they scope to questioning how they are scoped. Through this inversion of their approach to figures it can be understood as a probing tool, one for reflecting on and feeling out our means of producing knowledge.<br>Interestingly this movement of inverting the figure to understand its maker also resonates with the move of the social model of disabilitie’s inversion of the medical model which I talk more about in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.01_PoliticalRelational_Model</a> entry. In this move the social model's inversion of sedimented power relations and their practices, even though useful to understand certain aspects of power, can in some ways miss the nuance of relations. With a crip approach I look to trouble this by exploring how a figure can of course be inverted, but also what other relations and practices can I make room for when I choose to feel the frictions between figures and their backgrounds.<br>Figuring as a verb takes on the action of forming figures, of figuring things out and of composing or computing figures. within this diversity of forms and use of figure there is a focus on the tactility of thinking when we are working through them. Taken as method figuring makes room to apprehend the shape of something, of feeling out a figure, collating one together, and making wiggle room for another one to join. In this figuring out of space, much like with the noun, is this division of what is brought into being a figure and what is backgrounded to contour that figure. Lury et al. approaches this with Edgar Rubin’s psychological research into perception (1958), where his depiction of figure and ground are defined by the “contour” that runs between them. They give the example of the “Rubin vase”<a data-footref=\"3a\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fn-3-df6893fbe5f10211_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. With Ahmed I could similarly ask what contingent approaches and practises do I rely upon, turning back to them when feeling out contours of bodily-horizons, as I have not found another path I yet desire, or another background to figure out from. This is especially true within disability studies where the figure of the crip is only just disobediently emerging into discourse of other fields, and has always been kept in the background. With my crip figuring out it is to make wiggle room around these sedimented norms for this disabled figure to be contoured among, and with it the demands of critical access and disobedient relational politics of crip theory. <br>“The Old Testament “pre- figures” the New Testament, past and future are symbiotically shaped in, and indeed incarnated by, typology: Word made flesh\" (Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 2)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-df6893fbe5f10211_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>“the fig-ure of “man” figures who gets to be considered human by means of a series of constitutive exclusions (Mbembe 2017).

Lury et al. (ibid., 8) define configuring as a practice within complex systems design that makes room to join diverse elements into arrangement, never final even when \"stable\". It doesn’t refer to the final arrangement of components, but instead this practise of coalescing them together. Due to configuring being this process of bringing figures into action, as well as bringing the diverse elements of infrastructure together, it has been taken up by Science Technology Studies (STS) as a cornerstone critical methodology and mode of analysis. Lury et al.&nbsp;here points to Lucy Suchman’s definition of Configuration to demonstrate how this methodology can make room to inquire with “[a]t once action and effect”(2012, 49). Suchman’s definition makes room to understand how the stories that are told and the figures that are held in place produce specific sedimented practices of ordering. In configuration as method she makes room for a mode of analysis that can be an un/remaking through material practises and their knowledges. Lury et al.&nbsp;go on to trace configuration through the work of D. N. Rodowick (2001), Michel Foucault’s notion of similitude(2020), as well as Donna Haraway’s “string figures”(1997) and her Cyborg Manifesto (1985), which I touch on more in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. These movements by Lury et al.&nbsp;in many ways orients towards their understanding of Elizabeth Povinelli (2016) and Michelle Murphy (2017) work as practices of forming figures “equal to contemporary political configurations”(Lury, Viney, and Wark 2022, 10). Configure-Able Methods as I will go on to offer up, moves with these approaches of forming counter figures, but also (un)fixes these practices through impact centred design methods of critical access. Here making room to form wiggle room through these counter figures to disorient configurations from their sites of impact and friction.<br>To understand the importance of the (un)fixing and disorientation of -able further I am going to return to Suchman’s definition in her Configuration essay (2012) that Lury et al.&nbsp;touches on. This deeper reading of Suchman’s Configuration is due to it making room for me to understand why and how my research finds the need to disorient configuration through impact centred critical access methods and my disobedient methods. In doing this I am not aiming to de-legitimise this field, or Suchman's work, but to dance with them and to trouble the sedmineted norms they emerge from. In fact Suchman is taken up here as a refined version of STS, and an axis of STS for which I can disobediently crip and disorient configuration from. The other key reason for choosing Suchman’s definition is that in this essay she takes up medical infrastructures and with them the infrastructures of disability. Much like Alison Kafer’s taking up of disability within Haraway’s cyborg, which I discuss in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.02.04_Cripping_Technoscience</a> section. I am taking up a definition of configuration where disability is in the background but not yet made known or brought in reach of the research. Here I am making wiggle room within these STS methods for the disabled figure to emerge and with them disobediently bringing their crip politics, methods, practices and approaches.\n05.01.02.01_The STS axis<br>In Suchman’s essay (ibid.) she gives two examples both covering self-proclaimed bench mark digital infrastructure projects within health. The first inquiry around an speculative one fits all data management system for one of the largest health management organisation (HMO) in the US by Judith Gregory (2000) and the second around the government of rural Andhra Pradesh (India) and their implementation of their ‘Vision 2020’ policy, which undertook the implementation of a new health information infrastructures and documented by C. R. Ranjini (2007; 2006). I closely read into these two inquiries later in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> section in this chapter, but Suchman brings them together to offer up and reflect on their misfitting between plans and actions, or in these examples the determined datafied figures and their indeterminate material backgrounds. In both examples Suchman shares that these systems inevitably fail, not because their task of creating comprehensive healthcare tools is impossible, but because of the efficient, normalising, and reductive imaginaries and politics that they were operated through. As I shared earlier in this chapter with the brief summary of configuration Suchman uses this framework to think through how the figures, metrics and imaginaries, work in action. With configuration she brings together both the ways in which “technologies materialize cultural imaginaries, just as imaginaries narrate the significance of technical artefacts” (Suchman 2012, 48). In doing this she brings in-line how we plan, imagine and narrate things being done (often sedimented from a centralised, generalised and prescribed approach), with how it is situated through localised practises and material bodily horizons. By bringing these things in-line she aims to form configuration as a method of analysis which can making sense of the reverberations and frictions between situated knowings of systems through practise and the roles and figures which they can be reconfigured through. These two inquiries present this reverberation on each of their own system and infrastructure's bodily horizon to offer up what configuration as method is, and demonstrating how their sedimented norms can be radically disoriented through contingent practises of configuration.<br>The language I use at the end of the last paragraph is intentionally muddled with Ahmed’s from Queer Phenomenology (2006). This is not only because Ahmed’s work frames my research but also because Suchman’s configuration is also framed through Ahmed’s theories. Instead of Queer Phenomenology though, Suchman builds up from Ahmed’s figure of “the stranger”(2000). In this analysis she shares how Ahmed forms the stranger not as one who is unknown, but instead is recognised as the stranger. Much like the line that divides the family table, that I talk about closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_entries/01.01.00_Orienting_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Orienting_the_table</a>, Suchman takes up Ahmed’s line of inherited delineation to show how “inside(r)s and outside(r)s” are drawn and sedimented. Suchman works with this to show how “the stranger” is formed through citing Marx’s commodity fetishism and reorients it into ‘a fetishism of figures’(Ahmed 2000, 4) that can hold the fantasy and materiality of things together in a plastic form. Suchman later in the essay follows up this figure of the stranger by asking how to trouble the divide between user/designer/expert, and the inherent division between those who can configure out systems for strangers and those how have to live by strangers' figures.<br>Working from these two examples Suchman defines configuration through a rigid STS axis. This aims to take up examples which situate the work by embedding the STS expert within the field, through interviews, shadowing practitioners and researching paperwork. In some ways being embedded here for STS still means being a stranger, as quality research is only achieved through an exterior expert collating information to figure out these configurations reverberations. Suchman would debate this, as she does in her essay with Karen Barad’s notion of “Agency”(2007)<a data-footref=\"2b\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-45e4acc97f40f3e6_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> where she reminds us that we are entangled within the apparatus no matter our delineation. I very much agree with this but within the framework set out with Ahmed’s table, I ask how much is in reach from these rigid STS positions? And how can I disorient configuration by making room for my communities to reverberate between our matters and how we figure them out.Especially in the context of this research, of refusing big tech complicity and figuring out other approaches to cloud computing and community infrastructures, it could be asked why not turn to a more recent example of configuring methods? It would be very logical to look to something like Louise Amoore's Cloud Ethics (2020), where the centralised role of the expert is dispersed to those in touch with each other and the infrastructures. Her methodology also aligns with mine, where these challenges are made through counter figures, of telling narratives or stories, making songs and contextualising configurations in messy localities. I instead take this step back to Suchman's configuration (2012) not just because it helps to accessibly demonstrate the genealogy of configuration, but also as she takes up disabled matters, and life-affirming infrastructures. I later go on to show in cripping configuration that both Suchman and Amoore still seem to negate and invalidate disabled voices, politics and theory within their dialogues. In the next section's inquiry I firstly offer up how practices of critical access are in themselves radical impact centred configuring practices, and ones that configuring life-affirming infrastructures. In doing this I then return to this STS axis to share the necessity of this inflection of access, and why indeed we need to centre crip politics and practices in these debates, not negate and invalidate them. <br>“As Barad reminds us, we are always already inside the worlds that we take as the objects of our actions” (Suchman 2012, 57)<a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-45e4acc97f40f3e6_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 05.02.00_Inquiring into Critical AccessIn this next section I bring this genealogy of configuration out of line and queer it with this research’s cripping axis of inquiry. To do this I aim to translate the inflection of access-able to to that of configure-able through a tracing of access-knowledge and critical access. With this disorientating inflection I aim to inform the STS methods of configuration through those of Aimi Hamraie's tracing of flexible users (2017) and their understanding of access-knowledge. To do this I take into focus my own experiences of organising access for others as well as requesting access myself as inquiries into configuring practices informed through access-knowledge.<br>To start this inquiry into critical access it is interesting to first turn to -able as a suffix or as what I am calling here an inflection. -able or -ible’s etymology is traced from middle English, that comes from a French incursion of “-able”, and an empirical root in Latin with “-abilis”. This suffix’s etymology inflects “-able” to orient towards that of being able to do something, to enter, to be free from constraint or even gifted, but more specifically worthy of doing that thing or of being free. This sedimented line of “-able” being about worth is one that we still feel to this date, where questions of disabled people being worthy of access to basic care and a standard quality of life is still seemingly an open debate in the uk <a data-footref=\"41\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-041fc2525b97b11e_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Instead here, I orient to take a step back and disobediently retreat from these normative terms of -able and think through how critical access and crip studies might disorient it otherwise. Interestingly on the retreat we may pass the Old English suffix of “-endlic” that “-able” straightened out and overruled. “-endlic” instead of focusing on the value or worthiness of the subject, focuses on the material capacity. Inflecting a word with it means it is capable to, or able to do something. Why I stop here to catch a breath on the retreat is because it denotes a key aspect of critical access that I want to highlight. It is not about a person being worthy of access, but it is to orient access as a collective flexibility to do what we can materially, and to be honest and open about those flex-abilities, capacities and contours. Kafer poses an understanding of flexibility as \"not just extra time\" (2013, p.27) for disabled people, where \"rather than bend disabled bodies and minds to meet the clock, crip time bends the clock to meet disabled bodies and mind\"(ibid, p.27). This is similarly reflected on by Aimi Hamraie's tracing of the flexible user and the human factor (2017) within eugenics, industrial engineering and ergonomics beginning in the nineteenth century. The flexible \"user\" traced by Hamraie emerges from mass prosthetic manufacture after the world wars and poses soft human bodies, and the emergent human factor they make up within systems design, to be malleable problems to be cured by being shape by and for hard normalising systems and their processes. This in contemporary critiques is highlighted in the work of Renyi Hong's \"plasticity\" (2024), but especially in his critique of curative platforms (2024). This is where big tech platforms, like \"Grab, a leading superapp platform in Southeast Asia\", form narratives of disabled bodies as empowered by flexible work within a system and making room for them to choose when to work. In action thought this resulted pushing people with disabilities into precarious work and unsafe working environments, which never resulted in them having stability, agency or being empowered. It forced them to be flexible to the clock and processes of the app, and did not make room for or imagine their indeterminate bodies or their wider relational frictions.In response to these design politics Hamraie offers up the history of access-knowledge and of disabled people as knowers and makers to disorient hard machines to be flexible to softer bodies and build up the capacities within them for indeterminate crip bodies and their situated horizons. When we orient to how crip studies is practised around access in academia (Abrams, Floyd, and Abes 2024; Evans et al. 2024), and also from my own experiences of providing it, it is this place where we question the flexibility of the sedimented hard relations and politics of institutions, from the ways they conform disabled bodies within times, categories and metric figures, to how these invalidating practices validate and bring peoples needs into dialogue.\n“The disability to come . . . will and should always belong to the time of the promise. . . . it’s a crip promise that we will always comprehend disability otherwise and that we will, collectively, somehow access other worlds and futures.”\n—Robert McRuer, Crip Theor (McRuer and Bérubé 2006)\nIn the appendices of Feminist queer and crip Kafer (2013, 171–78) quotes McRuer above, before sharing her own materials from her practises of access. In this quote and in Kafer’s placement of it I interpret this “crip promise” that opens up crip futures as a promise of access that we make to ourselves and others around us. This promise of access for me is a call for life affirmation. It is a disorienting and inflecting action that moves towards affirming lives through emergent daily practices of access. By orienting life-affirmation on indeterminate access I don’t aim to determine what it is or can be, but aim to configure out the practices that can make room for life affirmation to be know-able through access in action. Stating access as a promise orients not as a static set of “universal” solutions or cures, such as the historic \"one best way\" (2017, p. 61) that Hamraie critiques. In this practise I know this is not something I can master or cure and there will never be a determinate \"one bast way\" or a solution to access. As Hamraie's forms it access-knowledge is produced through \"Flexible knowing (knowledge of a range of embodiments) and flexible design (designing for those embodiments)\", that form needs and access outcomes from situated bodies and not generalised or prescribed normid bodies. Hamraie shares the histories of access knowledge through the reverberation of section 504, and where barrier free access started to come into equality laws. In this recollection they share the many misfitting, iterations and localisations of these laws, as disable activists tried to make room in the generalised state and international level access laws for the situated diverse needs of the people with disability within America. These range form the ways mandatory policies were made advisories when taken to other states (turned into extra time), how barrier free access was scoped towards more traditionally socially visible disabilities, and how institutionalised barrier free access also pushed for circulation and visibility of disabled people, instead of giving them agency over their lives.<br>This troubling and reverberating of the rulers line through access-knowledge itself comes to a position of validating the collective labours, the possibility of institutional flexibility and the situated knowledges that it takes to be in a place or relation together. Bringing this back to Kafer, she demonstrates her access-knowledge through practise of making scent free spaces, and where the expanded relational understanding of access it undertakes is explicit. This is where all participant must be intimate with this room, considerate about what they clean themselves with and how they can stay chemical free until they reach this room. With Johanna Hedva’s Sick Woman Theory (2016) they also think through the ways access-knowledge troubles the normative roles of activism, and asks how can their be more room for expressions from those who cannot always be there in person due to illness, capacities or other life commitments. Hedva here transforms the understanding of what it is we can offer when we show up for justice. Another recollection of the many contexts of access-knowledge in action is Ren Britton's On Rehearsing Access (Britton, 2024) where access riders and their request are taken up as hacking tools to make room and flexibility in communities and institutions so disabled people can thrive within them. These patterns and practices of access knowledge differ greatly from a model of centralised control seen not only in the medical model, but also politics of neo-liberal austerity and their efficiency policies and imaginaries of sociopolitical infrastructures. In Suchman’s examples as I go on to share in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, some of my own in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a>, as well as Ahmed and Kafer’s work that i discuss in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table/01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01_Disability_justice_and_life_affirmation_flipping_the_table</a>, we have offered up how the pivotal action in centralised control is a holding of a determined line in place through invalidating penal logics, which almost always negate and silence the material relations, sense making and feedback of bodies. Understanding access knowledge as a promise of flexibility instead of a checklist (Kafer 2017), approaches it as an ongoing process of situated negotiation and a radical space of flexing lines and wiggling room for crip folks to participate how they feel able and desire to. This indeterminate promise and practice of access knowledge in action can seem overwhelming in the way that it is non-prescriptive, in need of deep intimacy and care as well as often admitting to not really have the capacity to meet the full needs of people. Saying this though I have been finding comfort in returning to this -endlic inflection of -ability, turning it from worth and towards capacity. Access in these terms takes so many paths converging and diverging between communities and institutions at each situated and messy locality, lines being drawn and woven together to configure a holey tapestry. The spaces missed and gaps out of reach of our communities thread giving form and horizon to this body, forming contours around what access is and can be. Here I am inquiring into how I approach my capacities when configuring access through a critical flexibility that aims to go between these divergent points, become intimate with the lines that divides the expertise within my communities and orient to practices of going into the unknown together. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cj937xylzyet\" target=\"_self\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cj937xylzyet</a><a href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-041fc2525b97b11e_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration<br>Access in my research can be addressed and understood in so many of the actions I have taken, from running events, making websites and infrastructures, learning to communicate and wiggle room with collaborators and even how I write academically right here. This has led me to reflect deeply on access-knowledge not only as a flexibility and capacity we build up around institutions and their norms through practice but also as one of the most divergent sites of impact to reconfigure complex systems from. By inquiring into access knowledge as configuration in practise, I aim to share how disability studies has inform my capacities for making room for the indeterminate needs and material limits of people and technologies around the sedimented norms of institutions. I have already written a lot on the many times I have encountered frictious access prepared by others and made me feel out of place, like at the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> or the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a>, or access that has made me feel understood and affirmed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>. Here though, I find it more pressing to share my experiences and inquiries around forming access with and for others, as well as reflecting on my requesting of access from institutions as reconfiguring practicises. Inquiring into these orientations, of both access requester towards institutions and collective provider within community work, I aim to trouble the sedimented division of user/designer/expert roles in practises of configuring access. This inquiry gives shape to configure-able methods, and how I aim to approach and care for these normalised institutional limits, forming wiggle room within and around them. In doing this though, I also aim to not so easily collapse pre-configure roles, like users, workshop participants and presenter, but instead be intimate with the intersectional capacities of those involved and how each person can orient themselves in locality together to configure collective access. To render this inquiry around Configure-Able methods I will focus on an initial attempt to meet people's access needs at a workshop I ran and which has inform the initial emergence of these methods. This was a workshop called Configure-Able Infrastructures I organised with NEoN digital. This was both my first attempt at a UKRI funded Knowledge Exchange (KE) but more importantly here, it was my first clear attempt at putting on an accessible workshop, and so has given me many misfittings, frictions and disorienting factors to reflect and learn from. These workshops were manifested as a place to explore and exchange dialogues of digital accessibility outside of big tech services, and was hosted by NEoN Digital Arts, a community based organisation focusing on digital access. I invited two groups to share their work. One was M.E.L.T. a crip digital arts collaboration of Ren Britton and Iz Paehr, presenting their Access Server work. The other person I invited was Ai Carmela from SysterServer to accessibly share technical skills of feminist network practices. These workshops in retrospect worked out okay for my first attempt at an accessible workshop, but left me quite anxious about how well I had managed it. This was in part not just because access in action is a steep learning curve when coming from the ableist norms of academic institutions and open-source community alike. From these institutions, flexibility is not asked but silently/violently demanded of the user, students, researchers or person approaching them, as our soft crip bodies and needs are stretched to fit the valid normid user's capacities and form. This being said these frictions and misfittings provide a quality example of how access-knowledge understood as configuration can be a generative tool for analysing the relations, politics, norms and imaginaries holding the current configurations of systems in place and which don't let them contextually flex to the soft bodies or needs they come in touch with in context.The focus of this inquiry is to reflect on the demands for bodies to be flexible by both academic and open-source institutional inflexibility in action. I also focus on the response to institutional inflexibility and the room for flexibility within the constellation of producers and presenters running the workshop. In this I aim to demonstrate how institutional norms reinforce roles of user/designer, prescribed/prescriber, where as communities actioned through forms of critical access can make wiggle room within how they contextualising their roles and relations beyond what is sedimented as inflexible. I will begin by orienting towards the workshops use of Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). I as an organiser had decided to try to run the workshop using FLOSS platforms and services hosted by different communities. This was mainly out of curiosity of what access was possible within FLOSS, but also to attempt a refusal to flex to the ableist norms of academia and big tech. The friction we had here originated from M.E.L.T. but reverberated among us, and came about due to this being an online workshop where we wanted to provide people with captions to access the workshops. The budget for this KE event was limited, so I oriented towards using auto-captions, and paying the presenters what I could. In trying to configure out a FLOSS video call with auto-captioning, I realised that this just did not exist (within reach). Default installs of Jiitsi did not have it, and even though there was some documentation on how to do it, I had not found an instance of it. With Big Blue Button (BBB) it had room for manual captioning but no wiggle room to automate it. This absence was overpowering in some ways, and showed how the Ableist norms of FLOSS did not centre accessibility or find it central to its future development. Access is very much was extra time for FLOSS. It also surfaces that if we want to be flexible to people's access needs we have to all flex to the inflexible politics, relations and protocols of big tech as the \"one best way\". Here though we refused their inflexibility and instead oriented towards forming access around FLOSS and away from big tech. To do this I providing a detailed “how to” for setting up a captioning system on a local machine. This sharing of knowledge and improvising of infrastructure made wiggle room for flexibility around how people improvise configurations of access-able alternatives to complicit big tech platforms. It also shares how through collaborative action we both felt design frictions, but made room to bridge that gap, improvise and flex the hard machines to wiggle some room within these misfittings for one afternoon. From this friction also came a generative conversation with Sabrina at NeoN, talking about auto-captioning compared to live captioning by a professional person or sonographer. We talked about how live-captioning by a person is not only more accurate but is itself a practice and an art form where they can add in more context but also creativity in the way they represent the dynamics and relations of what is being said. Here I did not want to replace the people who practice these vibrant and generative art forms, professions, and practitioners knowledges with clumsy and uniformed automation. When I think through access oriented like this, and as centring art and creaivity it again transforms the narrative of access from one of a burden and constraint, to one of joy and pleasure. In Lousie Hickman's video essay Crip AI (2021), she takes this into even closer detail to question how these histories of crip centred practices of sonographers are being overuled and left out of the dialogue when automating their practices and creative captions. Hamraie also shares how this is something of a norm when industrial design models approach disability, or even across fields. This is where these approaches do not navigate the methods, context or history of a field but just bluntly apply their own one best way of efficient design to it. With crip theory this unquestioned and prescribed move to the automation of access can also be understood as being more about relational politics which forcefully isolating disabled people by investing in ways to reduce funds for creative and intimate human centred practices of access-knowledge, care and joy within disabled lives. This isn't to say we shouldn't invest in their development, or to exclude the disabled people that might prefer these technologies to a person, but it is to make space for the option. It is like Hickman's Crip AI, which lays down the terms of if this is happening to us, we are making room in it to bring are backgrounds with us.Being honest in these workshops it was a mix of institutional inflexibility from KE funds to not support this type of access by default but also my unknowing of how to access more funds that led me to improvise this automated access. Here though instead of have the capacity to make room for better access and the captioning as art and joy full, we did manifest ways to form automated access without being entangled in the complicit \"one best way\" of big tech. With this I aim to demonstrate how these access frictions not only formed a generative place for us to locally and collectively analyse the configuration of automated creative captions and FLOSS, but also materially configure our own improvised alternatives then and there.From another orientation emerged a second friction from this workshop, with just as much inflexibility but this time coming from the academic institution. This friction came from the simple action of getting funds to pay individuals that had already been awarded to me to run from UKRI through the KE scheme. This fairly simple task became inaccessible to me, not because the money was not declared, but because the process itself was not clear or accessible, leaving me un-agential and unable to do this simple task. The background to this moment is that efficiently my departments admin team had been fired and they had hired new people but not trained them. In doing so made the practices they were hired to do inaccessible to both them and to requesting staff like me. In my context this meant spending months emailing back and forth with these admin \"experts\" trying to get them to pay the participants the money that was allocated for them. The lack of access here was shown in how I, as an early career researcher doing these things for the first time did not know exactly what to tell the admin person. In the opposite direction as a un-trained administrator, nor could they guide me to the right forms and process. In full there was no flex-ability for us to meet in the middle (even with a slight gap).\n05.02.02_Cripping Configuration\n05.03.00_ConclusionThis chapter in the thesis, is meant to hold an internal arc or inflection that disorients both this researchers path and their use of configuration as method. It inflects this research from inquiring into the dialogues of centralised plans to instead orient toward interdependent practices of configuring life affirming infrastructures from site of impact. Through forming a genealogy of configuration, and then inflecting it with a crip -able, I aim to have set a new background to configure out the rest of this thesis inquiries from., and one that centres places of impact and the design frictions that emerge in action. In the next chapters I take these Configure-Able Methods into deeper collective inquiries. In these inquiries I form a more nuanced and situated understanding of what practising critical access across multiple technical and social domains made know-able to collaborators and I around our practices of collective configuration. In doing this I aim to show how we can practice disability discourse not as a single issue topic, or where we have to participate in or assimilate to determinate dialogues, but instead centre critical access as a generative place to improvise community infrastructures around and configure interdependent life affirming futures from.\npandoc_orderinput-files:\n./05.00_Intro.md\n./05.01.00_Figuring

This inquiry builds out of In-grid's slowly sedimented collective practices and aims to highlight how through first person action research and disobedient action research methods I have introduced critical access as a critical framework and practice to reorient our ways of relating to and coalescing tables of social and technical infrastructure together. It specifically orients how we formed technical practices of collective access that disoriented the norms of expertise within our network and organisational practices and their knowledges. In this I aim to share how Crip theory and critical access doesn't have to be extra time or assimilationist, but can be a place to collectively orient from in the configuration of our communities and their infrastructures.To do this I am following of from prior chapters forming of <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>, I aim to go beyond that initial \"definition\" and move to feel it out in action and through collective inquiry. I do this by initially setting a background for these figures to emerge from, acting as a ground for In-grid's practices to be contoured and figured out from. I then reflect on a focus group I organised for In-grid members that reflected on the longer arcs in our collective practices through a framing of critical access. Here I made room for us to figure out frictions in these experiences and in doing so questioning the inflexibilities of the systems we felt. Orienting from these points we questioned how we had formed wiggle room around or within these points of impact through In-flex-ability. This is a recurring word play from us, where In-grid get In- to all sorts of trouble. In-flex-ability as we go on to define through action is manifested through interdependence in action, and where we can make room together to distribute and move around these systemic pressures and frictions, aiming to move towards how we want to collectively orient ourselves. This framing of In-flex-ability is also meant to move these dialogues beyond the problem/solution axis of curative design practices, and instead focus on how In-grid address and orient towards not only validating our feeling around these existing frictions, but make room for that feeling as part of the sense making and figuring out processes of configuration.<br>Working through this framing, I reflect on In-grids collective inquiry, as well as my first person inquiry, into how we approached these systemic inflexibilities through our collective in-flex-abilities. These inquiries then go on to take into closer consideration the technical network practices we undertook together. This inquiry resulted in the forming of accessible technical for the Servpub and Tinc VPN that I reflect on in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.00_configure-ability_in-docs.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs</a>.

In-grid's background rises from our emergence during a collective residency run at Arebyte Gallery in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. This was run by Rachel Falconner, Helen Pritchard and Rabecca Edwards. During this residency a group of 10-20 of us formed a set of skill shares and collaborations with artists and technical practitioners across a number of fields. This was held mostly online, and focused on people's fluctuating capacities during a very stressful and unpredictable pandemic, forming a very specific relation for working. We often joke about how this has trauma bonded us together.Since the residency we kept communing together, talking and keeping in touch. It was a year or so later when the pandemic and lock down started to ease that we began to come back together and regularly work again. This was during the first year of my PhD and during this time we built up multiple collective events, forming distributed ways of working and facilitating outcomes together. These ranged from a series of club nights/events called Real Bodies beginning at Corsica nightclub, with many installed works and performances, to Chain at Iklectic where In-grid formed a preformative infrastructure that evolved over the night. Since then we have kept working together forming other exhibitions, infrastructures and skill shares collectively, as well as slowly establishing our internal organisation practices in the small bits of time we can be together.Over this time people have joined and left, so we have balanced out to be a core group of 5-8 people and max 10-15 who can join in and contribute where they want and are able. These blury numbers may seem odd but they are due to our open door policy, which makes rooms for members to come and go as they need. This structure has formed through us orienting to make space for those of limited capacities due to work, life or health, as well as our constant lack of (institutional) funding that is common in community/arts work in post austerity UK. We also have a wide range of disciplines, capacities and approaches, from musicians to web developers and community activists. This brings an eclectic set of goal and desires to the background of this group.Another focus in this background is the 8M Trans*feminist counter cloud strike<a data-footref=\"t1\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> that we took a part of in 2021 and the years since with a number of different collectives in coalition. This meeting of many communities and collectives was also a major shift in In-grids desires and background. This strike focused on moving away from big tech ecologies and instead starting to invest our time, energy and resources into re-approaching how we can work with and for technical infrastructures towards our own collective orientation of them. These meetings formed the basis for our desire to not only question In-grid's own collective infrastructure but to also start to approach being in coalition with other communities.From this background I crop into two different scales of inquiry for this research. Within these inquiries and reflections I aim to both demonstrate Configure-Able Methods in action, and how they are localised within and emerge from In-grid's dynamic and intersectional background. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Background","level":2,"id":"Background_0"}],"links":["06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612924,"modifiedTime":1756048612925,"sourceSize":3461,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.01.00_Background.md","exportPath":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.01.00_background.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html":{"title":"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability","icon":"","description":"This section offers up a collective inquiry and reflection by In-grid around our longer term practices and where we processed together how Configure-able methods has manifested locally in our context.

With these questions around inflexibility we touched upon many different aspects of what this term could offer to us. One of the major points of disorientation within our dialogues and definition of inflexibility was when I brought crip studies into this conversation. This was after members of In-grid joked about capitalism being the ultimate inflexibility, forcing our bodies into uncomfortable and unwanted orientations just to get by. In response I agreed, bringing this jest into focus with crip studies opening up the ways it critiques capitalism's invalidation of bodies and matters through dialogues of productivity, value and normalisation. From this opening up of crip studies and critical access, we very much overflowed with experiences and critiques of the frictions we had felt together. One clear example we touched upon from reflecting on In-grids collective organisational practice is how banking systems make no room for organisations like us, yet we need a bank to work legally and be valid. This dynamic in practice left us not only with a very limited choice of one bank to work with, but the one that remained did not really match our politics. This process of getting that misfitting bank also took us months to sort out through their dysfunctional admin system, and our part-time non-expertise capacities. Here we made sense of these frictions and how these systems had taken us from how we wished we could orient ourselves (e.g. having easy flow of funds held by an ethical source) to the inflexible position of having a glitchy bank account profiteered off by unethical businesses.One point of friction around the definition of inflex came from whether restraints we put on ourselves could be understood as inflexibility. For example whether us keeping accountable to one another, taking our time and refusing certain relations or politics would be us being inflexible. Here I turned us again to this relational critique of access from crip studies, where the \"problem\" is not held in our individual bodies or needs being met, but rather in the social and systemic relations of politics that limit our ability to reach our needs that could otherwise be possible. With this notion inflexibility is positioned within the systems and their relations, in it needing us to perform specific roles (users), and with specific bodily figures and horizons (normids), to be able to be valid and approachable on their sedimented often inaccessible line. Reflecting on this later on though we do touch upon how In-grid, as our members work in institutes and were taught by them, have these systems and politics embedded in us, and how we have tried to make room to work through these frictions we feel in ourselves.

This topic's scope focused on our long term retreat from the norms of hosting our collective infrastructures with big tech cloud, to instead orient towards community and artist run cloud. This movement started after we had joined the 8M communities mentioned in the background of the chapter. During this transition we have slowly moved from a scattering of big tech cloud services to a focused collaboration of our cloud and network infrastructures held with Servus.Some of the inflexibility and frictions we felt when moving out of and retreating from the norms of Big Tech network infrastructures were how as a product/service which is divided into user/designer relations, it meant that we felt defined to a specific role and body with no agency. To do this these Big Tech cloud infrastructures often put people out of reach of the matteriality of what they are using, and aim to keep the user experience, and the shaping of the human factor friction-less. To keep these infrastructures even more out of reach the sedimented norms and defaults of sysadmin and network maintenance is oriented as a burden, joyless and friction-full. It is also often only done by the isolated expert working alone or from a distance to configure technical relations for other users who are strangers to them.To form wiggle room here specifically we practised in-flex-ability through interdependence and collaboration. In this moving our scoping from needing to take on this immense burden that is out of reach of us, to instead ask what we have capacity do as In-grid, and what we can rely on others for. For instance, we as a group could not host our cloud infrastructures due to member capacity, experience and knowledges as well as a number of other reasons, so are working with Servus to host them. In this relation forming wiggle room around the frictionles user roles we were forced into by big tech and instead through the frictions of working with Servus, gently coming into contact with and making sense of the material frictions of network infrastructures, our needs within them and how we want to orient towards them. On an experimental server we have hosted with them we have started to form more wiggle room here by starting to host our own VPN and distributed network, as well as a git code repository (we are working towards). This orienting of scales, capacities and scope towards interdependence and coalition made room for us to not only move off of the big tech cloud, but also towards building up relations with similar communities and putting these capacities in reach of our collective futures.

This work is very much emerging for In-grid, both in the sense that we are only just beginning to work with other collectives and communities but also in that we are starting to do more things and splinter off into smaller working groups. Both of these were places where we felt we needed to make room for feedback and exchange within the wider group for these practices and knowledges.The inflexibility and friction we felt here came from two points of impact. One was how we relates as a group and with others, and how these exchanges are handled. Here we reflected back to points where relations had induced anxiety and had a huge impact on our capacity for exchange. These for us often originated form relations where we felt like others were trying to catch people out, penalise them, or not open up relations on a personnel situated level without prescribing them to a role. This was mainly felt when working with other collaborators, but of course still existed internally. We felt that these sorts of sedimented relations of policing undermined not only our capacities to work together as we needed to constantly validate our position, but also our enthusiasm and energy for those collaborations. The other friction we return to is our lack of funding, and how this curtails our capacity to meet the many people and matters we have in relation with the intimacy we wish we could.To care for, feel out and wiggle room within these inflexibilities, In-grid reflected on how we try our softest to have patience and be generous with each other and other others. This for us meant taking time to share knowledge, make room to let it sink in, bringing clarity through repetition, not in a way to reinforce bodies and relations, but like a tic (Maier et al., 2020) when someone forgets or is lost we gently re-orient ourselves together. So when someones like \"why are we even bothering with banking/cloud/coalitions/being here it seems so much trouble\", we can again go over why we have chosen to put ourselves in awkward relations to practice in-flex-ability around these systemic Inflexibilities, but are doing this in a way that distributes and reforms these sedimented relations. It is when someone vulnerably turns up 2 months later and they need us to recap some of that time to be in-sync-ish. For In-grid it was also about figuring out ways of making these repetitions and in-flex-abilities joy-full even. This is still very much an ongoing dialogue and one where the many members of In-grid are slowly forming our own practices and politics that can refuse these penal norms we live among, and form wiggle room and social/systemic flexibility for people to bring their own ways of being together in our collaborations.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Working groups and knowledge exchange","level":4,"id":"Working_groups_and_knowledge_exchange_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.02_working-groups-and-knowledge-exchange.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612926,"modifiedTime":1756048612926,"sourceSize":2930,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.02.02.02_Working groups and knowledge exchange.md","exportPath":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.02_working-groups-and-knowledge-exchange.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.03_in-ternal_politics.html":{"title":"06.02.02.03_In-ternal_politics","icon":"","description":"Here In-grid turned in-ward to frictions within how we as a group figure out and orient our own collective politics in practice. This focus offered us room to reflect on how we as a group form goals and orient towards them. In this dialogue we also made room to question what those goals currently are. It also has to be said that this was definitely the most fun topic to chat about, with lots of joy and giggles, when reflecting on these impact of these frictions and our resulting care for them.The inflexibility we felt here orients a number of matters. This is explicit when we question what is possible with limited funding, what we can squeeze in around work and what (if any) of our activities are understood as valid and valued within these systems. We also touched upon how we as students of these academic institutions, teachers and researchers within them, as well as within the norms of other computing/creative industries have inherited and sedimented the politics and norms of these bodies within us. Here we ask how these norms reinforce us to be inflexible in certain ways so that the contingent politics and relations we orient towards are out of reach. One example we experienced and raised around this came from both academic institutional norms, as well as ones of communities around us, and which oriented towards the ease of centring knowledge in individuals as it was more efficient than dispersing it into collective knowledges. This centring of practises and their knowledges though situates all the capacity to do certain things within certain people. Here by not taking on this troublesome task of distributing these practices and their knowledges the organisation can loose these capacities easily in doing so, through certain people leaving, becoming ill/mad/dissociative or passing. Beyond this consolidating these practices and their knowledges into an individual also takes them out of reach of others, and makes no room for them to know those practices and politics as a group, or the plurality knowings that makes room for.In-response we reflected on how In-grid made room within and around these normalised institutionalised practices of management and collaboration that we have experienced. Becky and Katie surfaced a joke they have here about how if anyone needed to understand In-grid's methods and process, they should read the Simple Sabotage Field Manual (1944) by the CIA. This is not true in every way, we are not out to break our own things, like this manual suggest for taking down fascist states and their infrastructures. Instead when approaching collective practice In-grid is slow and we take our time, we are dedicated to working in large groups<a data-footref=\"t10\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.03_in-ternal_politics.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, have many misunderstandings<a data-footref=\"t11\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.03_in-ternal_politics.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and lots of emotions to share<a data-footref=\"t12\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.03_in-ternal_politics.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. These actions for us, and maybe because many in the manual were appropriated from anti-fascist, communist and anarchist movements are the many practices we have to come to decisions, build trust and get consensus from different members on our orientations. The many ways we orient this differently to the CIA manual of course is that the actions we take are done through love and care, where we aim to build up In-grid's relations, instead of weaponizing them. In many ways this shares how we do break down efficient management systems, but In-grids orients towards other ways of being together instead of replacing one fascist state with another. It is only through years of these relations building up that we have emerged the trust that makes room for members to take different approaches, forget what we were doing, and to be okay with being uncomfortable. For example getting our cloud setup moved to Servus took over a year to get everyone set up with account on it and for us to feel like we as a group knew what we are doing there. Still though there are some members who don't want to be on there and that is fine, and we have found ways to be in-flex-able around these points of friction so to not excluded them. In these ticing practices we build trust and patience in letting people manage their own way to reflect on and learn from our collective practices and their frictions. This demonstrates well our practice of in-flex-ability, and shares how we have wiggled room together within the sedimented and inherited norms for the flexibility In-grids member's need and manifest to be together within these inflexible systems and times. <br>\"Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five\" (CIA, 1944, p.&nbsp;28)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.02.03_in-ternal_politics.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Misunderstand\" orders.

We are a group of fairly technically capable people, and even though this was a new technical practice for us, it was hard to get to grips with what was going on at this table of network infrastructures. In reflection this was in many places due to the technical documentation and resources we were recommended, and which were quite abstract or incomplete. Beyond this the time/capacity In-grid had was very limited as it was mostly voluntary work at this stage and so it was a struggle to reach this dictated outcomes. The workshops and working sessions explaining the practice were also intensive and long sessions of terminal/console work, which often over ran, leaving everyone tired, discombobulated and unable to document or remember what had happened clearly. The formats of both felt fairly pre-configured and very rigid and did not make space for In-grid to have agency or input our background, approaches and ways of working around these sorts of frictions. Instead we were told \"why can't we be like others\", aka be quite and listen to/reproduce the \"one best way\" of feminist server practices.<br>Looking closer at the materiality of sysadmin as a technical process and practice it is quite specific in the ways it is made to be knowable. This practice for me personally has taken time to firstly understand and get used to the how the terminal environment works, finding handy commands, short keys and approaches that are absent from the very minimal void of an interface. The norms for this sort of terminal based sysadmin practice from my experience are written technical documentation which aim to act as references while you work. As part of our practice into this environment we started to make our own technical docs and as we came into contact with this practice, we started to question the norms of these sedimented approaches to configuring network infrastructures. From these sites of impact we questioned how these doc's formats made these practices know-able and perform-able in very specific ways and by specific people. Technical docs normally take on the form of text and code intervals, which often procedurally get you to run commands, whilst giving you little background knowledge into what is being done or why. A fine example of this is from an institution is Google's documentation on accessible web practices<a data-footref=\"2s\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, here they share does and don'ts, technical practices and share other resources that do help to make a more accessible web resource, but also mitigate any of the history or reasons for why. Their bland initiating statement \"We write our developer documentation with accessibility in mind\", orients from the start that they do not centre the impacts of access, and in doing so overrule the generative capacities these frictions would make there. When it came to the docs of Tinc<a data-footref=\"3p\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, the VPN we used, they are even less descriptive and just have code functions and commands abstractly explained in technical language and figures which are inaccessible to non-expert practitioners. Tinc's background and introductory information<a data-footref=\"1c\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-5-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> also isolates the scoping to what needs to be known to setup a VPN with Tinc, and gives little reason as to clearly state the orientation of this infrastructures social and political background. Reflecting on Tinc's docs through Hamraie's flexible user (2017), I understood these norms of technical docs as highly inflexible and were figured and shaped for a particular body of the expert/super user, that not many of In-grid would fit without friction. The norms of these formats and the expected users they make room for hold an inflexible promise or set of (political) intentions of a specific setup, pipeline or approach towards network infrastructuring. Being procedural dictating formats they prescribed expertise to specific relations, politics and figures for others to manifest their infrastructure through. Working with these standardised configurations of infrastructures can be understood as taking on the determined roles and operational metaphors of a system without capacity to question them, or be given space to localise, improvise and reinterpret them to local relations, desires and needs. To me this made me reflect on the ways that Miriyam Aouragh and Paula Chakravartty in Infrastructures of Empire (2016) discuss how infrastructures bring with them and reinforce the politics of the creator, and with this there is a need to question these inherited norms and make room for this locality when manifesting them. These norms of docs and their technical practices hold these infrastructures in space, in line and for most out of reach.Another key inflexibility of the Serpub infrastructure and these docs was the maintainability of its setup. This setup was predominantly based around the use of Tinc, which even though a relativley accessible VPN (compared to others) and one that comes from a genealogy of autonomous feminist servers, was becoming deprecated. This meant in many ways that any infrastructure based on these docs would (even if maintained) become obsolete, insecure and dysfunctional. This restraint to maintenance and deprecation crosses into all docs and infrastructures, but here provides a point of contact and friction to question how we would, with limited resources care for this technical infrastructural rot, and try to maintain the collective practices that go beyond them. <br>Katie Tindle, Batool Desouky, Sunni Lao, Rebecca Aston + Me.<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility\" target=\"_self\">https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-5-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Inflexibility","level":4,"id":"Inflexibility_0"}],"links":["06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fn-5-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html#fnref-5-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612928,"modifiedTime":1756048612928,"sourceSize":6171,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_Inflexibility.md","exportPath":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.01_inflexibility.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.00_in-flex-ability.html":{"title":"06.03.01.02.00_in-flex-ability","icon":"","description":"In questioning the horizon of these sedimented norms and the inflexibility we had felt both in the inherited configurations of technical docs as well as the social relations of how they were shared in practice, we wanted to make room to care for these frictions.

This chapter by Acton poses how to approach language, structuring and formating to re-configure them into more accessible plain language. This is not meant as a a reduction of what is there but a reinterpretation of how we represent, translate and figure these relations and dynamics to/with others in accessible forms. It is also meant as a way to open up different discourses, such as technical ones like these, to be within reach of the disabled community. In this approach challenging the scope of what disabled people (and others) can have expertise around, access to and intimacy with. Here informed by her concept we actioned this inquiry by firstly being conscious of Acton's principles<a data-footref=\"53\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.01_in-docs.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> but also thinking through how we can localise this dialogue into technical docs and our own capacities. To do this I turned to Acton's plain language version of Alice Wong's anthology of essays called Disability Intimacy (2024), which informed us how to orient towards plain language. We situated these alongside the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)<a data-footref=\"54\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.01_in-docs.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> to think about how a Plain -ish Language WCAG (P-ish-LWCAG) might be oriented.With this in focus In-grid started to reconfigure the limits of docs by trying to make room within their norms for docs to be improvisable and knowable by different capacities and approaches. One way we did this was by making more room in the introductory sections of docs to hold more information about the background of these infrastructures, and discussing what these technologies are and why we are using them in this infrastructure. We also made sure to take care of and cover the technical elements that the norms of docs from our experience would brushed over or straighten out. With this metaphorical curb cut in the introductions to sections, we aimed to form ways in for people to relate to these practices who had divergent backgrounds to the ones where these technical procedures had emerged from. In doing this we made room for bodies which did not fit that of a normid super user or expert and instead highlighted this misfitting, its frictions and points of contact as generative sites for that body to re-imagine and reconfigure these social and technical infrastructures. Through this approach we also emerged our own syntax and formats for clearly signing both links and technical code elements. For links this oriented going beyond descriptive links to give extra short descriptions below them for people to get a better idea of what lay beyond. For the code inserts we started to form our own standards of how to make the technical syntax docs encoded more legible and improvisable. To do this in code exerts we highlighted &lt;variables&gt; with these brackets, and followed this up with how we had run them ourselves. There is an example quoted below. We did this to also emphasise the readers capacity to improvise and adapt these practices to the persons own local context. With this trying to make room to run them as non-procedural practices which do not orient them to a specific user and determined technical infrastructure. In this motion troubling the procedural deterministic norms of docs to instead make room for people to access these practices and knowledges through divergent disorienting dialogues.\n\"Syntax: sudo tinc -n &lt;NETNAME&gt; init &lt;NODENAME&gt;\nSo we did: sudo tinc -n systerserver init servpub\"\n(In-grid, 2025)\n<br>Towards the end of writing the docs we also found through extended networks outside of Servpub of an earlier documentation from the XPUB docs<a data-footref=\"55\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.01_in-docs.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as well as Lurk's RUN YOUR OWN<a data-footref=\"56\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.01_in-docs.html#fn-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, that the VPN parts of the Servpub infrastructure were based on. These clearly showed how to setup these systems and would have saved us lots of time configuring out these infrastructures. It would have been sensible to follow the efficient \"Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY) mantra of course, but in some ways this repetition, or what Get the frac in (Maier et al., 2020) might explain as a \"Tic\", lead us to repeat the same stuff but maybe as plain-ish stuff. At this later stage we were also facing the fact that the VPN elements of these docs (TINC) were becoming deprecated. Feeling the impact of both of these frictions we decided to reorient again from the norms of docs being an active site to pose these docs as more of an archive documenting and make knowable this infrastructure's background.

Through these approaches we dedicated time to caring for, feeling out and inquiring into the figures we encountered together within the configurations of these infrastructures. This for me personally was the likes of rubbing up against Tinc's logo (+@fig:tincLogo), an Apache attack helicopter, and being reminded of Isabel Waidner's We are made of diamond stuff, where the narrator questions the US military naming practices (2019, pp.&nbsp;18-23). This is where \"They use words as weapons, they use weapons as weapons, and sometimes both come together in the Boeing CH-47 Chinook\"(ibid, pp.&nbsp;22), but also in the case of Tinc and it's Apache logo, how private networks are often conflated with and depicted through militaristic violence and colonial dominance. With a decolonial crip approach I would also understand with Hamraie's crip technoscience<a data-footref=\"51\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.02_in-practice.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and actioning how we can start to retreat these technical and social networks of privacy away from these sedimented roots of militaristic and colonial violence through community actions of access.<br><img alt=\"Tinc logo which shows a grey scale Apache attach helicopter behind tinc written in lower case black writing\" src=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_media/image1.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:tincLogo}In action and as a group we also found members being lost from graphviz diagrams, maps and representations of this closed VPN network and leaving them unable to help maintain or know these infrastructures easily. This was mainly due to Tinc being both hard to access across In-grid member's variety of operating systems (OS), as well as not much time given by mentors to access Tinc from non-linux systems. As In-grid we had to find hacks and improvisations to work together around these limits, for example using Linux terminals on another OS. There was also the for ever forgotten passwords for the for ever layers of security that these zero trust network norms of domination entail, and which we were not used to accessing. Working within Servpub we also encountered more poetic, symbolic and figural naming practices of computational systems which made wiggle room within them to re-orient these systems througha background of feminist histories, language and variability. These configurings out in practice are often impossible to portray through not only a static set of technical docs, but also essays like this here. They are about knowing through practice, and by taking actions within and around the materiality of these technical and social infrastructural relations and to feel their impact on your body. Instead of trying to cure these inevitable gap between theory and practise, In-grid oriented towards developing workshops for people to practise these docs and network practices through configure-able methods for themselves. When an opportunity arose for us to share this work at 4S/EASST 2024 in Amsterdam, we went about thinking how to formulate these practices into the first iteration of our workshop called Practising Protocols. This workshop accompanied a panel we organised and brought together with other members of community groups and collectives organising community infrastructures, some from the 8M strike. This included Donna Halford-Lovell from NEoN Digitial presenting their community work around digital access, Julia Nueno presenting her work with app delivery driver communities forming counter apps to unionise and empower with, Femke Snelting from TITiPI sharing their Counter cloud imaginaries, tactics and stickers, as well as members of SHAPE talking about their work.<br>Bringing the docs into contact with this plurality of community politics, imaginaries, and practice, also provoked us further to make wiggle room for these collective differences of context, needs and sensitivity in these practising protocols workshops. The name of practising protocols itself emerges from both its feminist STS roots, but also through a crip understanding of protocols as a place to dispute expert knowledged of systems through counter protocols<a data-footref=\"52\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.02_in-practice.html#fn-2-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. In doing this we thought of how to trouble the centralised and procedural practices of infrastructures through making more room within the practices they emerge from to localise and situate this knowledge and expertise with that of the working group.<br>For this initial workshop at 4S/EASST we decided to crop in to the docs to a very basic process of getting into one of the Servpub autonomous servers and collectively editing a html file that was being served online. This HTML would then hold the collective protocols we made during this workshop. We did this as this conference has attendance from a mixture of backgrounds, but is predominantly not a technical expert space. This setting offered us room to test what it meant to make these technical docs and their practices configure-able to people of these varying backgrounds, capacities and expriences. Within these steps of, sshing into the server, entering TMUX<a data-footref=\"57\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.02_in-practice.html#fn-3-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, editing a HTML doc in Nano<a data-footref=\"58\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.02_in-practice.html#fn-4-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and exiting the admin session together, we made room and took our time to question what we came into contact with, felt friction around and wanted to configure out otherwise together. This iteration and context gave us great feedback for how to run these workshops, with the final outcomes published publicly on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" target=\"_self\">panel blog</a> and within the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" target=\"_self\">html doc</a> we edited live together. From this initial iteration of the workshop we felt like Practising Protocols were a promising way of making room for groups to configuring out infrastructures together through an accessible process that made room for their embodied sense-making and expertise. In this iteration and workshop session it made space for us to emerge with the group a dialogue around how these practices and processes were pre-configured and imagined through specific logics of servitude, users and bodily relations, and ones where we as a group could start to discuss and form our own paths and orientation within, around and/or away from them.This workshop and panel combined worked well to make room for accessibly dialogues around the technical imaginaries and configuration practices of network infrastructures and collective organising. It formed a context where In-grid and participants could question how communities and collectives come together to form their own approaches, relations and figures locally. It was also a fairly radical to do this with a panel of \"experts\", that was run by a trans*feminist collective, and with participants from digital arts charities, union organising and radical counter cloud imaginaries at 4S/EASST. This could also be said for the accompanying workshop that made room for conference members to not only access the terminal and technical network practices together, but to disorient them into a social dialogue in which we configured out these technical practices in action together!It was also interesting to reflect on how radically different the points of friction and reflection were in this workshop at 4S/EASST, compared to the next iteration with In-grid. This was of course because it was with different people in a different contexts and with slightly altered content. Still though it also shows to me the generative capacity the Practicing Protocols workshops have for disorienting the norms of network configurations by making room for divergent and situated dialogues that bring technologies in touch with and reverberating from the bodies they impact. <br>\"A crip technoscience theoretical framework builds on feminist and decolonial technosciences to differentiate between technologies developed through models of disability- as- pathology (often in the name of rehabilitating injured soldiers) and those derived from dis-ability culture communities, where technology supports embodied differences and interdependent socialities.\" (Hamraie, 2023, p. 308)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.02.02_in-practice.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"The feminist STS concept of “protocol” (Murphy 2012) describes methodological practices that become both standardized and reiterated in pursuit of particular politi cal goals.

This workshop is a focus of this inquiry as it is the point at which I made room for these technical network practices, that were made know-able through smaller working groups on the Servpub project over long periods, to be brought back and made accessible and known to the larger group of In-grid. The scope for this workshop's actions were to do the initial configuring out and setting up of our collective server. This initiation of our network infrastructure made room for In-grid members to build up our technical capacities and emerge future collective and community projects from. The actions of this workshop were contextually quite simple ones, and oriented setting up our first virtual private server (VPS) hosted with Servus and in doing so providing In-grid members with their \"user\" accounts and access to these infrastructures. Along side this technical practice we also figuring out of our own iteration of protocols and intentions for this platform as we came into contact with it and made sense of these frictions. This simplicity of the workshop also aimed to make room to welcomed the wider group of In-grid members to this server space, and through this bring these network practices in-touch with In-grids background. Playfully I named this workshop (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This followed on from this researches methodology, where we made room to collectively inquiry into how we wanted to imagine, tell tales of, and configure out In-grids in-frastructure together.Fortunately I had managed to get a bit of funding from the University for these workshops, which enabled me to go up to London and do the event in person with In-grid members. Even though this was the case a number of In-grid members were running an exhibition in east London at the time, and so Yewen Jin who had volunteered to look after the exhibition asked if we could make it a hybrid event, so we pivoted onto a video call. In this workshop funding I had also factored in refreshments into this budget which meant we could eat and commune together before/during/after the workshop. This was important to bring these social, caring and joyous elements into our in-frastructure. For the access needs form I also made room within its inflexible limits to be oriented through pleasure by not only providing inputs for people's access needs and dietaries, but also for communal joy and indeterminate. I did this by asking what people's favourite snacks and treats were as well as for them to suggest music for the workshop playlist within this access form.Sunni Liao had kindly volunteered their flat for us to meet and do this workshop in. That morning before the workshop me and Sunni had met up and gone climbing like we do together when I am in London. We caught up about life whilst we warmed up and fell off the wall many times. We rushed back to their flat to get ready for the workshop, and prep everything. Sunni cooked up some tasty food for us, while I got the treats and workshop ready. Other Members of In-grid started to arrive and we caught up and got ready together. Running slightly behind we ate as we began the workshop.With Yewen online and the rest of us settling in we started to go through the workshop and practised our protocols as we configured out our server for the first time. Most members of In-grid, especially the ones who were present, are fairly computer and coding literate, with some having existing knowledge of server practices. This meant for the workshop, I could put more focus on querying and feeling out the protocols we were actioning, In this we made room within them to be disoriented by our sense making of relations and feeling of friction from our embodied expertise. To do this I made wiggle room within slides I edited down from the Servpub docs I discussed earlier, making room for us to reflect within each step of this processes, and orient from these points of contact. In each of these creating a sub inquiries into how In-grid would collectively figure out each of these protocols locally. These spaces of reflection are named in context of their actions and were made up of Coding protocols, SSH protocols, Sudo protocols, User protocols, Digital safe space protocols, Collective working protocols. <br>After this collective figuring out of network protocols I asked us to write In-grid's first collective server manifesto together. To do this I made room for us to reflect on the feminist server manifesto (Constant, 2015) and form our own alignments and orientations to/from it. From here we itterated into our own manifesto as a way to coalese these knowledges from this practising of protocols and its collective sense-making into the background of our manifesto. Here manifesting a server as we manifested its manifesto. The resulting Femfester manifesto with a small intro was then published in first edition of Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024).

To figure this out we spent time chatting and writing up these imagined roles together. This configure-able room around roles emerged them within In-grid's locality as maintainers, carers and caretakers of this infrastructure, but also personas, players and characters. These all also oriented towards this server and our infrastructure being a collaborator in our collective, moving it from a normalised user/using hidden servers relationship, to one oriented towards mutual care. This is highlighted within the middle of the notes in the comment \"it is nice to be individuals in a collective\".

This meant that only a person on a device with that key and its password can access that user on that server, making it \"secure\". This is the standard or \"norm\" of security for a server with a public IP like this, and realistically does keep this space \"safe\" within the materialised military imaginaries of a zero trust encryted web that we exist in today (Spencer &amp; Pizio, 2024). This relation became a place we found friction within these infrastructural inflexibilities that left In-grid asking what other imaginaries of safety and privacy could we imprint on our server from our background. Here I think influenced by the feminist server manifesto we talked a lot about transparency. We discussed how transparency even though performs the making visible of dynamics, is in many ways a barrier in place that is there to make a system \"secure\" from intervention. In this performance of transparency is also the filtering and orienting of these material practices and their background into the abstract languages and representative figures that form the knowledge of experts. Instead we started to ask how we could disorient these sedimented relations of security and transparency through critical access. In our notes this is highlighted by the desire to not \"ring-fence around particular roles\" or their knowledges, and the need to not have \"knowledge lie with one person\". With these statements refusing this figure of the expert user, and orienting to community and collective knowledges. To do this we thought about how safety for us is not about static barriers of security or hierarchical roles that reinforce each other, but to be intimate with who we are with and what we are doing. From this discussion our safety comes then not from a checklist, keys charters or generalised deterministic set of conditions, but from taking time to build trust by making room for each other to form dialogues and exchanges in-flex-able ways. Within network practices this was particularly relevant, as we did not want each other to be intimidated (by the already intimidating technology), so forming relations of trust that centred access of these technologies was key. We came up with many protocols and practices for achieving this, from again working in pairs/groups, researching/checking/quadruple-checking before we took actions, and collectively demystifying these systems to all be experts on what these protocols and technologies are to us all.

This sounds very complicated, but basically lets you work collaboratively within one terminal together and is used for collective server work. I wanted to bring this collaborative interface into focus as it does have many restraints and frictions for collaborative working. These range from basic things like classic obscure terminal copy and paste commands, but also that there is only one person able to write at one time, and the possibility of accidentally loosing sessions by typing exit (even in another command). In the pad and session though the reflections focus mainly on technical elements of TMUX as the limits above gave us a few technical issues members couldn't quite get beyond. We were also running a little out of time so decided to move on from this and to focus on writing the manifesto together. Reflecting on this brief contact though, it was interesting to see how collaboration in these technologies is configured through very restrictive relations, and when a group like us, who collaborate in a number of dynamics and approaches, found this pre-configured relation too tight and misfitting to our needs. In-grid was definitely not the imagined expert users of TMUX, but being in touch with these constrained collaborative environments showed us how much these relations needed us to form wiggle room within them.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Collective working protocols.","level":4,"id":"Collective_working_protocols._0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.06_collective_working_protocols..html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612931,"modifiedTime":1756048612931,"sourceSize":1456,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.02.06_Collective_working_protocols..md","exportPath":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.06_collective_working_protocols..html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html":{"title":"06.03.02.07_Manifesting_Femfester","icon":"","description":"Emerging out of this foreground and the workshop's wiggling of room in these technical protocols we turned our attention to the collective writing of our initial Manifesto for this server. To do this we talked as a group about how we wanted to orient our approach to this. To start this off In-grid members chatted about what the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant, 2015) meant to them, and what they thought of it, with members being excited for us to take on iterating our own version as it had been an inspiration to members of the group. We decided that a collective reading of the original Feminist Server Manifesto would be a nice way to initiate this, and then follow it up by commenting on, iterating through and figuring out our own manifesting of it. In this reading we took turns to read lines in non-hierarchical and improvised form with members dynamically taking up where others left off, and echoing back to earlier collective reading practices and performances In-grid has done<a data-footref=\"59\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.We followed this up by doing another In-grid practice of synchronous free writing in a shared pad. This is a practice we have emerged that makes room for members to anonymously let ideas and thoughts out, making it a very relaxed way to start ideation and get a feel of how the group is oriented. After this free writing we started to form alignments with the manifesto by writing out the original lines, talking through them and figuring out how \"our lines\" oriented from theirs. We only had time to go through half of them in the session, as people had time constraints, but here again we were in-flex-able around this. To do this we turned to an a-sync work flow where we wrote on the etherpad and online. Through this process of reorienting the manifesto and feeling out a few points where we wiggled from their path. Here we re-oriented many of these issues through critiques and figures of access, asking how we as a group can imagine and materialise these approaches in our network practices. This ranged from caring for the frictions of accessing a server collectively, to making room for those difficulties to be knowable and accessible by others. In this orientation we formed our own impact centred critical access informed dialogues and practices that disoriented \"transparency\". In-grid's central figure of reorientation of this emerged from our dedication to interdependence as a pivotal to our manifesting. The original Feminist Server manifesto does clearly come from community and a place of interdependence, but we wanted to emphasise interdependence as the figure that made room for In-grid's manifesting. In this move we also reoriented from not apologising for not being available (all the time), to learning to communicate our capacities and feel out and take care around our limits, both individual/collective. This for me also opens this manifesting to being a practice that changes over time, and one that aims to not only reveal but also build up our capacities within relation. We did in many places not wiggle from the original manifestos path though, finding alignment in the refusal of security, of exposing insecurities and avoiding ease-of-use. Again though we found it important to reaffirm these moves through abolitionist concepts and wordings. Over the next week or two we worked together asynchronously to edit and finesse together this manifesto, along with a short intro, for publication with Servus and the first edition of their Artists Running Datacentres journal (Davide Bevilacqua, 2024). Here it was engulfed in a further plurality of research, interviews and practitioner knowledges from across Servus' community. This manifesto aligns with the provocation of the original Feminist sever manifesto (ibid), as well as with this researches approach of flawed and crazed crip manifesting (Kafer, 2017, 2023). This is where in its essence, the Femfester not only makes space for itself to be more crazed, poetic and visceral but also yearns to be iterated through its misfitting in action, and frictions made and felt within complex systems and configurations of community infrastructures. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Manifesting Femfester","level":4,"id":"Manifesting_Femfester_0"}],"links":["06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html#fn-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html#fnref-1-57d19ea3bb534c9d_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612931,"modifiedTime":1756048612932,"sourceSize":4246,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_Manifesting_Femfester.md","exportPath":"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.07_manifesting_femfester.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.04.00_in-reflection.html":{"title":"06.04.00_In-reflection","icon":"","description":"In reflecting on our <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a>, our development of accessible doc practices, to make room for Serv(er)ing In-grid by Practicing Protocols to Femfester together our first server manifesto in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.00_configure-ability_in-.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-</a> section, I aimed to offer up how configure-able methods can make room within relations for the flexibility our collective and communal bodies need and orient towards within our sociotechnical infrastructures.

This inquiry builds out of In-grid's slowly sedimented collective practices and aims to highlight how through first person action research and disobedient action research methods I have introduced critical access as a critical framework and practice to reorient our ways of relating to and coalescing tables of social and technical infrastructure together. It specifically orients how we formed technical practices of collective access that disoriented the norms of expertise within our network and organisational practices and their knowledges. In this I aim to share how Crip theory and critical access doesn't have to be extra time or assimilationist, but can be a place to collectively orient from in the configuration of our communities and their infrastructures.To do this I am following of from prior chapters forming of <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>, I aim to go beyond that initial \"definition\" and move to feel it out in action and through collective inquiry. I do this by initially setting a background for these figures to emerge from, acting as a ground for In-grid's practices to be contoured and figured out from. I then reflect on a focus group I organised for In-grid members that reflected on the longer arcs in our collective practices through a framing of critical access. Here I made room for us to figure out frictions in these experiences and in doing so questioning the inflexibilities of the systems we felt. Orienting from these points we questioned how we had formed wiggle room around or within these points of impact through In-flex-ability. This is a recurring word play from us, where In-grid get In- to all sorts of trouble. In-flex-ability as we go on to define through action is manifested through interdependence in action, and where we can make room together to distribute and move around these systemic pressures and frictions, aiming to move towards how we want to collectively orient ourselves. This framing of In-flex-ability is also meant to move these dialogues beyond the problem/solution axis of curative design practices, and instead focus on how In-grid address and orient towards not only validating our feeling around these existing frictions, but make room for that feeling as part of the sense making and figuring out processes of configuration.<br>Working through this framing, I reflect on In-grids collective inquiry, as well as my first person inquiry, into how we approached these systemic inflexibilities through our collective in-flex-abilities. These inquiries then go on to take into closer consideration the technical network practices we undertook together. This inquiry resulted in the forming of accessible technical for the Servpub and Tinc VPN that I reflect on in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.00_configure-ability_in-docs.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs</a>. From these we also emerged a set of workshops to make more space for these collective figuring out practices that we ran at 4S/EASST 2024 as well as internally, which I reflect on in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_configure-ability_in-workshops.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a>. From these In-flex-able technical network practise I reflect on the counter figures and configurations we manifested along the way, as well as the emergence into In-grid's first Feminist Server Manifesto, that we called Femfester and published with Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024). 06.01.00_BackgroundTo form the figures of this inquiry I will first start by forming the background for them to emerge from, and trace the long tail that builds up to contour these bodies. In-grid's background rises from our emergence during a collective residency run at Arebyte Gallery in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. This was run by Rachel Falconner, Helen Pritchard and Rabecca Edwards. During this residency a group of 10-20 of us formed a set of skill shares and collaborations with artists and technical practitioners across a number of fields. This was held mostly online, and focused on people's fluctuating capacities during a very stressful and unpredictable pandemic, forming a very specific relation for working. We often joke about how this has trauma bonded us together.Since the residency we kept communing together, talking and keeping in touch. It was a year or so later when the pandemic and lock down started to ease that we began to come back together and regularly work again. This was during the first year of my PhD and during this time we built up multiple collective events, forming distributed ways of working and facilitating outcomes together. These ranged from a series of club nights/events called Real Bodies beginning at Corsica nightclub, with many installed works and performances, to Chain at Iklectic where In-grid formed a preformative infrastructure that evolved over the night. Since then we have kept working together forming other exhibitions, infrastructures and skill shares collectively, as well as slowly establishing our internal organisation practices in the small bits of time we can be together.Over this time people have joined and left, so we have balanced out to be a core group of 5-8 people and max 10-15 who can join in and contribute where they want and are able. These blury numbers may seem odd but they are due to our open door policy, which makes rooms for members to come and go as they need. This structure has formed through us orienting to make space for those of limited capacities due to work, life or health, as well as our constant lack of (institutional) funding that is common in community/arts work in post austerity UK. We also have a wide range of disciplines, capacities and approaches, from musicians to web developers and community activists. This brings an eclectic set of goal and desires to the background of this group.<br>Another focus in this background is the 8M Trans*feminist counter cloud strike<a data-footref=\"t1\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-60bd09aa399cbfc6_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> that we took a part of in 2021 and the years since with a number of different collectives in coalition. This meeting of many communities and collectives was also a major shift in In-grids desires and background. This strike focused on moving away from big tech ecologies and instead starting to invest our time, energy and resources into re-approaching how we can work with and for technical infrastructures towards our own collective orientation of them. These meetings formed the basis for our desire to not only question In-grid's own collective infrastructure but to also start to approach being in coalition with other communities.From this background I crop into two different scales of inquiry for this research. Within these inquiries and reflections I aim to both demonstrate Configure-Able Methods in action, and how they are localised within and emerge from In-grid's dynamic and intersectional background. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-1-60bd09aa399cbfc6_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability<br>This section offers up a collective inquiry and reflection by In-grid around our longer term practices and where we processed together how Configure-able methods has manifested locally in our context. To do this I initiated a focus group and working session called In-fra processing to reflect back over these years of work together with In-grid members through the framing of Configure-able methods. This became a place for us to make room around/within and to trouble the frictions and inflexibilities we felt from our experiences of configuring these systems through our collective practices of Configure-Ability. This focus group was also run as part of the annual In-grid In-ternal residency to make room for us to query and reorient our approaches together as we went forward. This session was run as a very relaxed online call where we got together and took collective notes and reflections on this <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing\" target=\"_self\">pad</a>. Here we initially started by figuring out some of the inflexibility we had felt in practice and from them recollected our collective practices of in-flex-ability in practise. Doing this we aimed to frame our configure-able methods and practices of in-flex-ability by making-sense of how we approached and reoriented the norms of these relations we came in contact with.\n06.02.01.00_Figuring_out_InflexibilityWhen defining inflexibility, I proposed a few questions and prompts for us to work through together and to make room for us to define these terms by reflecting on our experiences of our collective practice. With these questions around inflexibility we touched upon many different aspects of what this term could offer to us. One of the major points of disorientation within our dialogues and definition of inflexibility was when I brought crip studies into this conversation. This was after members of In-grid joked about capitalism being the ultimate inflexibility, forcing our bodies into uncomfortable and unwanted orientations just to get by. In response I agreed, bringing this jest into focus with crip studies opening up the ways it critiques capitalism's invalidation of bodies and matters through dialogues of productivity, value and normalisation. From this opening up of crip studies and critical access, we very much overflowed with experiences and critiques of the frictions we had felt together. One clear example we touched upon from reflecting on In-grids collective organisational practice is how banking systems make no room for organisations like us, yet we need a bank to work legally and be valid. This dynamic in practice left us not only with a very limited choice of one bank to work with, but the one that remained did not really match our politics. This process of getting that misfitting bank also took us months to sort out through their dysfunctional admin system, and our part-time non-expertise capacities. Here we made sense of these frictions and how these systems had taken us from how we wished we could orient ourselves (e.g. having easy flow of funds held by an ethical source) to the inflexible position of having a glitchy bank account profiteered off by unethical businesses.One point of friction around the definition of inflex came from whether restraints we put on ourselves could be understood as inflexibility. For example whether us keeping accountable to one another, taking our time and refusing certain relations or politics would be us being inflexible. Here I turned us again to this relational critique of access from crip studies, where the \"problem\" is not held in our individual bodies or needs being met, but rather in the social and systemic relations of politics that limit our ability to reach our needs that could otherwise be possible. With this notion inflexibility is positioned within the systems and their relations, in it needing us to perform specific roles (users), and with specific bodily figures and horizons (normids), to be able to be valid and approachable on their sedimented often inaccessible line. Reflecting on this later on though we do touch upon how In-grid, as our members work in institutes and were taught by them, have these systems and politics embedded in us, and how we have tried to make room to work through these frictions we feel in ourselves. 06.02.02.00_Figuring_out_In-flex-abilityWhen it came to defining In-flex-ability in a similar way, and where I had prepared some prompts and questions, we instead decided to orient to figuring it out in inquire and action. Here we reflected on how we improvised other ways of approaching these places of friction within the sedimented norms we felt friction with. As a group we decided on which practice's frictions and misfittings we wanted to orient from and in which ways we wanted to approach them. This resulted in us making sense of in-flex-ability by reflecting on the inflexibilty we felt in our processes and practices of De/re-clouding, Coalition and knowledge exchange and our In-ternal politics. When doing these it took us a minute to warm up to this framing of inflexibility/in-flex-ability, but through this emerged some interesting points of collective reflection.\n06.02.02.01_De-re-cloudingThis was our first topic and opened up to us to discus for a while as we felt out this framing of analysis. This topic's scope focused on our long term retreat from the norms of hosting our collective infrastructures with big tech cloud, to instead orient towards community and artist run cloud. This movement started after we had joined the 8M communities mentioned in the background of the chapter. During this transition we have slowly moved from a scattering of big tech cloud services to a focused collaboration of our cloud and network infrastructures held with Servus.Some of the inflexibility and frictions we felt when moving out of and retreating from the norms of Big Tech network infrastructures were how as a product/service which is divided into user/designer relations, it meant that we felt defined to a specific role and body with no agency. To do this these Big Tech cloud infrastructures often put people out of reach of the matteriality of what they are using, and aim to keep the user experience, and the shaping of the human factor friction-less. To keep these infrastructures even more out of reach the sedimented norms and defaults of sysadmin and network maintenance is oriented as a burden, joyless and friction-full. It is also often only done by the isolated expert working alone or from a distance to configure technical relations for other users who are strangers to them.To form wiggle room here specifically we practised in-flex-ability through interdependence and collaboration. In this moving our scoping from needing to take on this immense burden that is out of reach of us, to instead ask what we have capacity do as In-grid, and what we can rely on others for. For instance, we as a group could not host our cloud infrastructures due to member capacity, experience and knowledges as well as a number of other reasons, so are working with Servus to host them. In this relation forming wiggle room around the frictionles user roles we were forced into by big tech and instead through the frictions of working with Servus, gently coming into contact with and making sense of the material frictions of network infrastructures, our needs within them and how we want to orient towards them. On an experimental server we have hosted with them we have started to form more wiggle room here by starting to host our own VPN and distributed network, as well as a git code repository (we are working towards). This orienting of scales, capacities and scope towards interdependence and coalition made room for us to not only move off of the big tech cloud, but also towards building up relations with similar communities and putting these capacities in reach of our collective futures. 06.02.02.02_Working groups and knowledge exchangeFor this focus we reflected on how we as a collective have worked with others and exchanged knowledge, practices and built relations along the way. This work is very much emerging for In-grid, both in the sense that we are only just beginning to work with other collectives and communities but also in that we are starting to do more things and splinter off into smaller working groups. Both of these were places where we felt we needed to make room for feedback and exchange within the wider group for these practices and knowledges.The inflexibility and friction we felt here came from two points of impact. One was how we relates as a group and with others, and how these exchanges are handled. Here we reflected back to points where relations had induced anxiety and had a huge impact on our capacity for exchange. These for us often originated form relations where we felt like others were trying to catch people out, penalise them, or not open up relations on a personnel situated level without prescribing them to a role. This was mainly felt when working with other collaborators, but of course still existed internally. We felt that these sorts of sedimented relations of policing undermined not only our capacities to work together as we needed to constantly validate our position, but also our enthusiasm and energy for those collaborations. The other friction we return to is our lack of funding, and how this curtails our capacity to meet the many people and matters we have in relation with the intimacy we wish we could.To care for, feel out and wiggle room within these inflexibilities, In-grid reflected on how we try our softest to have patience and be generous with each other and other others. This for us meant taking time to share knowledge, make room to let it sink in, bringing clarity through repetition, not in a way to reinforce bodies and relations, but like a tic (Maier et al., 2020) when someone forgets or is lost we gently re-orient ourselves together. So when someones like \"why are we even bothering with banking/cloud/coalitions/being here it seems so much trouble\", we can again go over why we have chosen to put ourselves in awkward relations to practice in-flex-ability around these systemic Inflexibilities, but are doing this in a way that distributes and reforms these sedimented relations. It is when someone vulnerably turns up 2 months later and they need us to recap some of that time to be in-sync-ish. For In-grid it was also about figuring out ways of making these repetitions and in-flex-abilities joy-full even. This is still very much an ongoing dialogue and one where the many members of In-grid are slowly forming our own practices and politics that can refuse these penal norms we live among, and form wiggle room and social/systemic flexibility for people to bring their own ways of being together in our collaborations.\n06.02.02.03_In-ternal_politicsHere In-grid turned in-ward to frictions within how we as a group figure out and orient our own collective politics in practice. This focus offered us room to reflect on how we as a group form goals and orient towards them. In this dialogue we also made room to question what those goals currently are. It also has to be said that this was definitely the most fun topic to chat about, with lots of joy and giggles, when reflecting on these impact of these frictions and our resulting care for them.The inflexibility we felt here orients a number of matters. This is explicit when we question what is possible with limited funding, what we can squeeze in around work and what (if any) of our activities are understood as valid and valued within these systems. We also touched upon how we as students of these academic institutions, teachers and researchers within them, as well as within the norms of other computing/creative industries have inherited and sedimented the politics and norms of these bodies within us. Here we ask how these norms reinforce us to be inflexible in certain ways so that the contingent politics and relations we orient towards are out of reach. One example we experienced and raised around this came from both academic institutional norms, as well as ones of communities around us, and which oriented towards the ease of centring knowledge in individuals as it was more efficient than dispersing it into collective knowledges. This centring of practises and their knowledges though situates all the capacity to do certain things within certain people. Here by not taking on this troublesome task of distributing these practices and their knowledges the organisation can loose these capacities easily in doing so, through certain people leaving, becoming ill/mad/dissociative or passing. Beyond this consolidating these practices and their knowledges into an individual also takes them out of reach of others, and makes no room for them to know those practices and politics as a group, or the plurality knowings that makes room for.<br>In-response we reflected on how In-grid made room within and around these normalised institutionalised practices of management and collaboration that we have experienced. Becky and Katie surfaced a joke they have here about how if anyone needed to understand In-grid's methods and process, they should read the Simple Sabotage Field Manual (1944) by the CIA. This is not true in every way, we are not out to break our own things, like this manual suggest for taking down fascist states and their infrastructures. Instead when approaching collective practice In-grid is slow and we take our time, we are dedicated to working in large groups<a data-footref=\"t10\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-752bef8f8cd1babd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, have many misunderstandings<a data-footref=\"t11\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-752bef8f8cd1babd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and lots of emotions to share<a data-footref=\"t12\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-752bef8f8cd1babd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. These actions for us, and maybe because many in the manual were appropriated from anti-fascist, communist and anarchist movements are the many practices we have to come to decisions, build trust and get consensus from different members on our orientations. The many ways we orient this differently to the CIA manual of course is that the actions we take are done through love and care, where we aim to build up In-grid's relations, instead of weaponizing them. In many ways this shares how we do break down efficient management systems, but In-grids orients towards other ways of being together instead of replacing one fascist state with another. It is only through years of these relations building up that we have emerged the trust that makes room for members to take different approaches, forget what we were doing, and to be okay with being uncomfortable. For example getting our cloud setup moved to Servus took over a year to get everyone set up with account on it and for us to feel like we as a group knew what we are doing there. Still though there are some members who don't want to be on there and that is fine, and we have found ways to be in-flex-able around these points of friction so to not excluded them. In these ticing practices we build trust and patience in letting people manage their own way to reflect on and learn from our collective practices and their frictions. This demonstrates well our practice of in-flex-ability, and shares how we have wiggled room together within the sedimented and inherited norms for the flexibility In-grids member's need and manifest to be together within these inflexible systems and times. <br>\"Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five\" (CIA, 1944, p.&nbsp;28)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-1-752bef8f8cd1babd_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Misunderstand\" orders.

In this reflection on our longer term organisational practice we surfaced how In-grid has actioned our network infrastructuring practices, our in-ternal politics and our practices of collaboration and knowledge exchange by making room within the limiting norms for our members to have flexibility within their approach to this collective practice. As a collective we also took up configure-able methods within these figures and relations to think about how we want to orient our collective body, and in which ways we can make flexibility within and around these hard systems and infrastructures. This ranged from even just acknowledging that some things are just out of reach, and openly stating how we wished we could orient ourselves, but also to taking direct actions within the spaces we do have agency, like the ways we relate to one another as well as the technologies we collaborate with and through. In-grid's orientation of in-flex-ability in action makes room for us to not only acknowledge the systemic inflexibility to work around them in situated and flexible ways, but also to acknowledge how these systems have made impressions on us, and how we have inflexibility in ourselves in the way we can come together or make room for the unknown-able other, within our social and technical plans and actions.This processing of In-configure-able methods and In-flex-able practice in action sets up the framing for the next section which takes a closer examination of how this has been collectively actioned in relation to network infrastructures, their technical docs, and the ways these practises and their knowledges are shared. In this collective inquiry giving depth to the understanding of both how Configure-able methods were manifested in this intersectional context.\n06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-These next two sections take on a closer inquiry into how Configure-able methods have emerged through In-grid's network infrastructuring practices. Our enactment of the methods here approach how these technical practices and their knowledges are shared. I initially approach this inquiry through first person action research reflections around our collective technical and documentation practices. I then follow this up with a in-ternal In-grid workshop as an example of how these methods have manifested both accessible social and technical practises to make room for groups to disorient and figure out network infrastructure as we configure them.\n06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs<br>A lot of this specific practice is currently being written up on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Chapter_3:_Praxis_Doubling\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Chapter_3:_Praxis_Doubling\" target=\"_self\">Servpub Wikic4Print</a>, and orients these reflections through a collaborative text alongside other members of In-grid, which this thesis restraints do not make room for. Here though I want to surface how in collaboration with In-grid, and with my critical input from this research we collectively tried to query the norms of technical practice, and their docs through critical access. By taking up critical access here we are both asking how can we make room for these practices and their knowledges to be more accessible to wider groups and dialogues through the ways we describe and format this information, but also how this can make space for people to dispute, unsediment and disorient together the network infrastructures we have inherited.<br>Carrying on the framing from the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> section, where In-grid orients approaching systemic inflexibility through our collective practice of In-flex-ability, I share how we have started to make room around these norms.\n06.03.01.01_Inflexibility<br>Here I initiate this inquiry by examining the inflexibilities we found both within the social and technical aspects when making the docs for the Servpub infrastructure. When the sub working team of In-grid<a data-footref=\"r2\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> initially tried to figure out the practices necessary for the Servpub infrastructure from other communities within the collaboration and the official docs of the VPN (Tinc<a data-footref=\"1s\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>), we found it inaccessible and full of barriers for a few reasons. We are a group of fairly technically capable people, and even though this was a new technical practice for us, it was hard to get to grips with what was going on at this table of network infrastructures. In reflection this was in many places due to the technical documentation and resources we were recommended, and which were quite abstract or incomplete. Beyond this the time/capacity In-grid had was very limited as it was mostly voluntary work at this stage and so it was a struggle to reach this dictated outcomes. The workshops and working sessions explaining the practice were also intensive and long sessions of terminal/console work, which often over ran, leaving everyone tired, discombobulated and unable to document or remember what had happened clearly. The formats of both felt fairly pre-configured and very rigid and did not make space for In-grid to have agency or input our background, approaches and ways of working around these sorts of frictions. Instead we were told \"why can't we be like others\", aka be quite and listen to/reproduce the \"one best way\" of feminist server practices.<br>Looking closer at the materiality of sysadmin as a technical process and practice it is quite specific in the ways it is made to be knowable. This practice for me personally has taken time to firstly understand and get used to the how the terminal environment works, finding handy commands, short keys and approaches that are absent from the very minimal void of an interface. The norms for this sort of terminal based sysadmin practice from my experience are written technical documentation which aim to act as references while you work. As part of our practice into this environment we started to make our own technical docs and as we came into contact with this practice, we started to question the norms of these sedimented approaches to configuring network infrastructures. From these sites of impact we questioned how these doc's formats made these practices know-able and perform-able in very specific ways and by specific people. Technical docs normally take on the form of text and code intervals, which often procedurally get you to run commands, whilst giving you little background knowledge into what is being done or why. A fine example of this is from an institution is Google's documentation on accessible web practices<a data-footref=\"2s\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, here they share does and don'ts, technical practices and share other resources that do help to make a more accessible web resource, but also mitigate any of the history or reasons for why. Their bland initiating statement \"We write our developer documentation with accessibility in mind\", orients from the start that they do not centre the impacts of access, and in doing so overrule the generative capacities these frictions would make there. When it came to the docs of Tinc<a data-footref=\"3p\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-4-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, the VPN we used, they are even less descriptive and just have code functions and commands abstractly explained in technical language and figures which are inaccessible to non-expert practitioners. Tinc's background and introductory information<a data-footref=\"1c\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-5-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> also isolates the scoping to what needs to be known to setup a VPN with Tinc, and gives little reason as to clearly state the orientation of this infrastructures social and political background. Reflecting on Tinc's docs through Hamraie's flexible user (2017), I understood these norms of technical docs as highly inflexible and were figured and shaped for a particular body of the expert/super user, that not many of In-grid would fit without friction. The norms of these formats and the expected users they make room for hold an inflexible promise or set of (political) intentions of a specific setup, pipeline or approach towards network infrastructuring. Being procedural dictating formats they prescribed expertise to specific relations, politics and figures for others to manifest their infrastructure through. Working with these standardised configurations of infrastructures can be understood as taking on the determined roles and operational metaphors of a system without capacity to question them, or be given space to localise, improvise and reinterpret them to local relations, desires and needs. To me this made me reflect on the ways that Miriyam Aouragh and Paula Chakravartty in Infrastructures of Empire (2016) discuss how infrastructures bring with them and reinforce the politics of the creator, and with this there is a need to question these inherited norms and make room for this locality when manifesting them. These norms of docs and their technical practices hold these infrastructures in space, in line and for most out of reach.Another key inflexibility of the Serpub infrastructure and these docs was the maintainability of its setup. This setup was predominantly based around the use of Tinc, which even though a relativley accessible VPN (compared to others) and one that comes from a genealogy of autonomous feminist servers, was becoming deprecated. This meant in many ways that any infrastructure based on these docs would (even if maintained) become obsolete, insecure and dysfunctional. This restraint to maintenance and deprecation crosses into all docs and infrastructures, but here provides a point of contact and friction to question how we would, with limited resources care for this technical infrastructural rot, and try to maintain the collective practices that go beyond them. <br>Katie Tindle, Batool Desouky, Sunni Lao, Rebecca Aston + Me.<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-1-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-2-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility\" target=\"_self\">https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-3-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-4-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-5-803df583409493cb_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 06.03.01.02.00_in-flex-abilityIn questioning the horizon of these sedimented norms and the inflexibility we had felt both in the inherited configurations of technical docs as well as the social relations of how they were shared in practice, we wanted to make room to care for these frictions. To do this we coalesced these practices towards In-grid's own background and promise of collective access. The sub working group of In-grid members met many times together over on greenhost jitsi video calls as we often do to have collective dialogue. Together here we reflected on how we wanted to enact these practices, thinking about what structures and formats made room for this information to be understood and configured otherwise by us.By making wiggle room within these constrained practices, we made room for them to be flexible towards our ways of working and politics. Here we were also keen to inquire how we could form wiggle room for others to disorient and configure out these docs otherwise for them selves. In this move we wanted to question the expertise and knowledge within these systems, moving it from the isolated and determinate super users to chaotic collective in practice. In this motion bring a plurality of bodies into contact with these infrastructure to make sense of them from many points of impact, friction and knowing. This approach aiming to not just disorient the compliant technical expert and designer but to make room for the figure of a disobedient user who brings with them their community and context.\n06.03.01.02.01_In-Docs<br>To question the barriers of technical language and sedimented formats of technical docs I suggested we orient to crip studies and Kelsie Acton's chapter Plain Language for Disability Culture (2023). This chapter by Acton poses how to approach language, structuring and formating to re-configure them into more accessible plain language. This is not meant as a a reduction of what is there but a reinterpretation of how we represent, translate and figure these relations and dynamics to/with others in accessible forms. It is also meant as a way to open up different discourses, such as technical ones like these, to be within reach of the disabled community. In this approach challenging the scope of what disabled people (and others) can have expertise around, access to and intimacy with. Here informed by her concept we actioned this inquiry by firstly being conscious of Acton's principles<a data-footref=\"53\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-a5eeddb51a287c31_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> but also thinking through how we can localise this dialogue into technical docs and our own capacities. To do this I turned to Acton's plain language version of Alice Wong's anthology of essays called Disability Intimacy (2024), which informed us how to orient towards plain language. We situated these alongside the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)<a data-footref=\"54\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-a5eeddb51a287c31_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> to think about how a Plain -ish Language WCAG (P-ish-LWCAG) might be oriented.With this in focus In-grid started to reconfigure the limits of docs by trying to make room within their norms for docs to be improvisable and knowable by different capacities and approaches. One way we did this was by making more room in the introductory sections of docs to hold more information about the background of these infrastructures, and discussing what these technologies are and why we are using them in this infrastructure. We also made sure to take care of and cover the technical elements that the norms of docs from our experience would brushed over or straighten out. With this metaphorical curb cut in the introductions to sections, we aimed to form ways in for people to relate to these practices who had divergent backgrounds to the ones where these technical procedures had emerged from. In doing this we made room for bodies which did not fit that of a normid super user or expert and instead highlighted this misfitting, its frictions and points of contact as generative sites for that body to re-imagine and reconfigure these social and technical infrastructures. Through this approach we also emerged our own syntax and formats for clearly signing both links and technical code elements. For links this oriented going beyond descriptive links to give extra short descriptions below them for people to get a better idea of what lay beyond. For the code inserts we started to form our own standards of how to make the technical syntax docs encoded more legible and improvisable. To do this in code exerts we highlighted &lt;variables&gt; with these brackets, and followed this up with how we had run them ourselves. There is an example quoted below. We did this to also emphasise the readers capacity to improvise and adapt these practices to the persons own local context. With this trying to make room to run them as non-procedural practices which do not orient them to a specific user and determined technical infrastructure. In this motion troubling the procedural deterministic norms of docs to instead make room for people to access these practices and knowledges through divergent disorienting dialogues.\n\"Syntax: sudo tinc -n &lt;NETNAME&gt; init &lt;NODENAME&gt;\nSo we did: sudo tinc -n systerserver init servpub\"\n(In-grid, 2025)\n<br>Towards the end of writing the docs we also found through extended networks outside of Servpub of an earlier documentation from the XPUB docs<a data-footref=\"55\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-a5eeddb51a287c31_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as well as Lurk's RUN YOUR OWN<a data-footref=\"56\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-4-a5eeddb51a287c31_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, that the VPN parts of the Servpub infrastructure were based on. These clearly showed how to setup these systems and would have saved us lots of time configuring out these infrastructures. It would have been sensible to follow the efficient \"Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY) mantra of course, but in some ways this repetition, or what Get the frac in (Maier et al., 2020) might explain as a \"Tic\", lead us to repeat the same stuff but maybe as plain-ish stuff. At this later stage we were also facing the fact that the VPN elements of these docs (TINC) were becoming deprecated. Feeling the impact of both of these frictions we decided to reorient again from the norms of docs being an active site to pose these docs as more of an archive documenting and make knowable this infrastructure's background. This is displayed well within the VPN with Tinc page<a data-footref=\"1w\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-5-a5eeddb51a287c31_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> where we formed wiggle room within these docs for the histories and genealogies of infrastructures, and to share how different collective bodies, relations and practice can manifest and disorient these normalised infrastructures when they have brought them within reach. <br>\"Note on writing: This chapter is written in what I call a semi- plain language style.

These processes and practices of making space to reflect on what is being done and how, comes both from the emerging internally methods of In-grid, but have also had an impression made on them when being in contact with other collectives of Servpub collaboration such as Creative Crowds and SysterServer. It also builds up with Hamraie's notion of \"design friction\"(2023), centring those at the site of impact to re-imagine, redesign and reconfigure the infrastructures and systems they are in touch with. Through these approaches we dedicated time to caring for, feeling out and inquiring into the figures we encountered together within the configurations of these infrastructures. This for me personally was the likes of rubbing up against Tinc's logo (+@fig:tincLogo), an Apache attack helicopter, and being reminded of Isabel Waidner's We are made of diamond stuff, where the narrator questions the US military naming practices (2019, pp.&nbsp;18-23). This is where \"They use words as weapons, they use weapons as weapons, and sometimes both come together in the Boeing CH-47 Chinook\"(ibid, pp.&nbsp;22), but also in the case of Tinc and it's Apache logo, how private networks are often conflated with and depicted through militaristic violence and colonial dominance. With a decolonial crip approach I would also understand with Hamraie's crip technoscience<a data-footref=\"51\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-1619569f47ad57dd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and actioning how we can start to retreat these technical and social networks of privacy away from these sedimented roots of militaristic and colonial violence through community actions of access.<br><img alt=\"Tinc logo which shows a grey scale Apache attach helicopter behind tinc written in lower case black writing\" src=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_media/image1.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:tincLogo}In action and as a group we also found members being lost from graphviz diagrams, maps and representations of this closed VPN network and leaving them unable to help maintain or know these infrastructures easily. This was mainly due to Tinc being both hard to access across In-grid member's variety of operating systems (OS), as well as not much time given by mentors to access Tinc from non-linux systems. As In-grid we had to find hacks and improvisations to work together around these limits, for example using Linux terminals on another OS. There was also the for ever forgotten passwords for the for ever layers of security that these zero trust network norms of domination entail, and which we were not used to accessing. Working within Servpub we also encountered more poetic, symbolic and figural naming practices of computational systems which made wiggle room within them to re-orient these systems througha background of feminist histories, language and variability. These configurings out in practice are often impossible to portray through not only a static set of technical docs, but also essays like this here. They are about knowing through practice, and by taking actions within and around the materiality of these technical and social infrastructural relations and to feel their impact on your body. Instead of trying to cure these inevitable gap between theory and practise, In-grid oriented towards developing workshops for people to practise these docs and network practices through configure-able methods for themselves. When an opportunity arose for us to share this work at 4S/EASST 2024 in Amsterdam, we went about thinking how to formulate these practices into the first iteration of our workshop called Practising Protocols. This workshop accompanied a panel we organised and brought together with other members of community groups and collectives organising community infrastructures, some from the 8M strike. This included Donna Halford-Lovell from NEoN Digitial presenting their community work around digital access, Julia Nueno presenting her work with app delivery driver communities forming counter apps to unionise and empower with, Femke Snelting from TITiPI sharing their Counter cloud imaginaries, tactics and stickers, as well as members of SHAPE talking about their work.<br>Bringing the docs into contact with this plurality of community politics, imaginaries, and practice, also provoked us further to make wiggle room for these collective differences of context, needs and sensitivity in these practising protocols workshops. The name of practising protocols itself emerges from both its feminist STS roots, but also through a crip understanding of protocols as a place to dispute expert knowledged of systems through counter protocols<a data-footref=\"52\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-2-1619569f47ad57dd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. In doing this we thought of how to trouble the centralised and procedural practices of infrastructures through making more room within the practices they emerge from to localise and situate this knowledge and expertise with that of the working group.<br>For this initial workshop at 4S/EASST we decided to crop in to the docs to a very basic process of getting into one of the Servpub autonomous servers and collectively editing a html file that was being served online. This HTML would then hold the collective protocols we made during this workshop. We did this as this conference has attendance from a mixture of backgrounds, but is predominantly not a technical expert space. This setting offered us room to test what it meant to make these technical docs and their practices configure-able to people of these varying backgrounds, capacities and expriences. Within these steps of, sshing into the server, entering TMUX<a data-footref=\"57\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-3-1619569f47ad57dd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, editing a HTML doc in Nano<a data-footref=\"58\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-4-1619569f47ad57dd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and exiting the admin session together, we made room and took our time to question what we came into contact with, felt friction around and wanted to configure out otherwise together. This iteration and context gave us great feedback for how to run these workshops, with the final outcomes published publicly on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" target=\"_self\">panel blog</a> and within the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" target=\"_self\">html doc</a> we edited live together. From this initial iteration of the workshop we felt like Practising Protocols were a promising way of making room for groups to configuring out infrastructures together through an accessible process that made room for their embodied sense-making and expertise. In this iteration and workshop session it made space for us to emerge with the group a dialogue around how these practices and processes were pre-configured and imagined through specific logics of servitude, users and bodily relations, and ones where we as a group could start to discuss and form our own paths and orientation within, around and/or away from them.This workshop and panel combined worked well to make room for accessibly dialogues around the technical imaginaries and configuration practices of network infrastructures and collective organising. It formed a context where In-grid and participants could question how communities and collectives come together to form their own approaches, relations and figures locally. It was also a fairly radical to do this with a panel of \"experts\", that was run by a trans*feminist collective, and with participants from digital arts charities, union organising and radical counter cloud imaginaries at 4S/EASST. This could also be said for the accompanying workshop that made room for conference members to not only access the terminal and technical network practices together, but to disorient them into a social dialogue in which we configured out these technical practices in action together!It was also interesting to reflect on how radically different the points of friction and reflection were in this workshop at 4S/EASST, compared to the next iteration with In-grid. This was of course because it was with different people in a different contexts and with slightly altered content. Still though it also shows to me the generative capacity the Practicing Protocols workshops have for disorienting the norms of network configurations by making room for divergent and situated dialogues that bring technologies in touch with and reverberating from the bodies they impact. <br>\"A crip technoscience theoretical framework builds on feminist and decolonial technosciences to differentiate between technologies developed through models of disability- as- pathology (often in the name of rehabilitating injured soldiers) and those derived from dis-ability culture communities, where technology supports embodied differences and interdependent socialities.\" (Hamraie, 2023, p. 308)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-1-1619569f47ad57dd_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"The feminist STS concept of “protocol” (Murphy 2012) describes methodological practices that become both standardized and reiterated in pursuit of particular politi cal goals.

This workshop is a focus of this inquiry as it is the point at which I made room for these technical network practices, that were made know-able through smaller working groups on the Servpub project over long periods, to be brought back and made accessible and known to the larger group of In-grid. The scope for this workshop's actions were to do the initial configuring out and setting up of our collective server. This initiation of our network infrastructure made room for In-grid members to build up our technical capacities and emerge future collective and community projects from. The actions of this workshop were contextually quite simple ones, and oriented setting up our first virtual private server (VPS) hosted with Servus and in doing so providing In-grid members with their \"user\" accounts and access to these infrastructures. Along side this technical practice we also figuring out of our own iteration of protocols and intentions for this platform as we came into contact with it and made sense of these frictions. This simplicity of the workshop also aimed to make room to welcomed the wider group of In-grid members to this server space, and through this bring these network practices in-touch with In-grids background. Playfully I named this workshop (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This followed on from this researches methodology, where we made room to collectively inquiry into how we wanted to imagine, tell tales of, and configure out In-grids in-frastructure together.Fortunately I had managed to get a bit of funding from the University for these workshops, which enabled me to go up to London and do the event in person with In-grid members. Even though this was the case a number of In-grid members were running an exhibition in east London at the time, and so Yewen Jin who had volunteered to look after the exhibition asked if we could make it a hybrid event, so we pivoted onto a video call. In this workshop funding I had also factored in refreshments into this budget which meant we could eat and commune together before/during/after the workshop. This was important to bring these social, caring and joyous elements into our in-frastructure. For the access needs form I also made room within its inflexible limits to be oriented through pleasure by not only providing inputs for people's access needs and dietaries, but also for communal joy and indeterminate. I did this by asking what people's favourite snacks and treats were as well as for them to suggest music for the workshop playlist within this access form.Sunni Liao had kindly volunteered their flat for us to meet and do this workshop in. That morning before the workshop me and Sunni had met up and gone climbing like we do together when I am in London. We caught up about life whilst we warmed up and fell off the wall many times. We rushed back to their flat to get ready for the workshop, and prep everything. Sunni cooked up some tasty food for us, while I got the treats and workshop ready. Other Members of In-grid started to arrive and we caught up and got ready together. Running slightly behind we ate as we began the workshop.With Yewen online and the rest of us settling in we started to go through the workshop and practised our protocols as we configured out our server for the first time. Most members of In-grid, especially the ones who were present, are fairly computer and coding literate, with some having existing knowledge of server practices. This meant for the workshop, I could put more focus on querying and feeling out the protocols we were actioning, In this we made room within them to be disoriented by our sense making of relations and feeling of friction from our embodied expertise. To do this I made wiggle room within slides I edited down from the Servpub docs I discussed earlier, making room for us to reflect within each step of this processes, and orient from these points of contact. In each of these creating a sub inquiries into how In-grid would collectively figure out each of these protocols locally. These spaces of reflection are named in context of their actions and were made up of Coding protocols, SSH protocols, Sudo protocols, User protocols, Digital safe space protocols, Collective working protocols. <br>After this collective figuring out of network protocols I asked us to write In-grid's first collective server manifesto together. To do this I made room for us to reflect on the feminist server manifesto (Constant, 2015) and form our own alignments and orientations to/from it. From here we itterated into our own manifesto as a way to coalese these knowledges from this practising of protocols and its collective sense-making into the background of our manifesto. Here manifesting a server as we manifested its manifesto. The resulting Femfester manifesto with a small intro was then published in first edition of Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024). Below I reflect on this collective inquiry and the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">notes</a> from the (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ workshop to give insight into what we came into contact with, disoriented with our embodied expertise and made friction with when configured this collective network infrastructure out together otherwise.\n06.03.02.01_Coding_protocolsThis room was made at the beginning of the workshop and before we started the technical parts of workshop to make space for us to reflect on and propose our codes of conduct together before we encode our social and technical infrastructures through them. We questioned how we desired to work together on this server and what relations we imagined and planned for ourselves. Here we focused on interdependence, on doing things in pairs, keeping people in-sync and making room for a-sync processes. We also focused on working slowly, being soft, and double, no triple checking before we do things. There was also a focus on documentation, not only as a way of keeping people in-sync, but also as a way to roll back or undo decisions and actions (where possible).\n06.03.02.02_SSH_protocolsHere we formed rubbed up against and wiggled room within the secure shell (SSH) protocol, which is the protocol that lets you communicate with a server. This is the first point that we came into contact with the server, and SSH configures the way we can connect, interface and be intimate with our server. There is little written feedback in the workshop notes on the pad, apart from \"1. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\". This is partially as we were still warming into collective note taking, but this note leads from a conversation we had about the embedded metaphor and figure of SSH as a hand shake. Within this conversation we opened up dialogues around the figures we want to replace. Instead of a handshake which reinforces able bodiedness within a normid user and with that the hierarchical relation and inaccessible contract making between particular kinds of bodies (white men). Here we started to imagine what metaphors we wanted to configure our relations to our infrastructure through. This particular friction did not generate any outcomes of counter figures, unlike others latter on, as I feel we may have still been warming into the process. It did though open up this dialogue of how we wanted to move towards other figures of our own. We wanted to find a practice and relation where we do not negate or hide these histories in our retreat from them, but disorient their bodies and relations through the impression of our retreat.\n06.03.02.03_Sudo_protocolsOnce logged in to the server through SSH we reached Sudo, which is the command \"super user do\". This is needed to do most of the admin tasks on a server as it gives you the rights to do so. Here we found friction with this sort of responsibility and expertise being individualised to specific \"super\" users and that imagined body. In response to this we turned to orient around interdependence as a way to not only slow each other down and see things from a number of perspectives but to hold each other response-able through our distributed expertise. We also questioned how we could do this, asking questions like \"can we track who is doing what as sudo?\" Instead in conversation In-grid turned to questions of how we as a group could not formalise trust through security, tracking, etc., but through social technologies of interdependence, moving to further build trust between us socially, instead of solely through our technical systems.\n06.03.02.04_User_ProtocolsOnce in sudo we then started to make everyone a user account for the server. These user accounts are the ones that each of us access the server through and as a configuration orients the singular standardised individualised user on a device. Here was a very generative space for forming our own counter figures and found much joy in configuring ourselves, our roles and how we wanted to relate to each other on this server. In the reflective room around this point of contact we opened up a dialogue of how we desired to disorient the norms and sedimented relations that the figure of the User represents. Instead of users, which pull from eugenics histories and imagine a particular normid body (Hamraie, 2017), and servers, which emerge from traditions of hidding labour (Krajewski &amp; Iurascu, 2018), collectively we started to imagine how we wanted to orient our relations in this room. To figure this out we spent time chatting and writing up these imagined roles together. This configure-able room around roles emerged them within In-grid's locality as maintainers, carers and caretakers of this infrastructure, but also personas, players and characters. These all also oriented towards this server and our infrastructure being a collaborator in our collective, moving it from a normalised user/using hidden servers relationship, to one oriented towards mutual care. This is highlighted within the middle of the notes in the comment \"it is nice to be individuals in a collective\". This is where we reflected on the bounds of these individual users and the server they are situated on merge, but also where the individual or user inside/outside of and around a collective or infrastructure can offer us other imaginaries of how our relations might be configure-able to their locality.\n06.03.02.05_Digital_safe_space_protocolsThis wriggle room for reflection was made when members uploaded their SSH keys to their user (carer/maintainer/character/collaborator/persona) account so that we could turned off password access. This meant that only a person on a device with that key and its password can access that user on that server, making it \"secure\". This is the standard or \"norm\" of security for a server with a public IP like this, and realistically does keep this space \"safe\" within the materialised military imaginaries of a zero trust encryted web that we exist in today (Spencer &amp; Pizio, 2024). This relation became a place we found friction within these infrastructural inflexibilities that left In-grid asking what other imaginaries of safety and privacy could we imprint on our server from our background. Here I think influenced by the feminist server manifesto we talked a lot about transparency. We discussed how transparency even though performs the making visible of dynamics, is in many ways a barrier in place that is there to make a system \"secure\" from intervention. In this performance of transparency is also the filtering and orienting of these material practices and their background into the abstract languages and representative figures that form the knowledge of experts. Instead we started to ask how we could disorient these sedimented relations of security and transparency through critical access. In our notes this is highlighted by the desire to not \"ring-fence around particular roles\" or their knowledges, and the need to not have \"knowledge lie with one person\". With these statements refusing this figure of the expert user, and orienting to community and collective knowledges. To do this we thought about how safety for us is not about static barriers of security or hierarchical roles that reinforce each other, but to be intimate with who we are with and what we are doing. From this discussion our safety comes then not from a checklist, keys charters or generalised deterministic set of conditions, but from taking time to build trust by making room for each other to form dialogues and exchanges in-flex-able ways. Within network practices this was particularly relevant, as we did not want each other to be intimidated (by the already intimidating technology), so forming relations of trust that centred access of these technologies was key. We came up with many protocols and practices for achieving this, from again working in pairs/groups, researching/checking/quadruple-checking before we took actions, and collectively demystifying these systems to all be experts on what these protocols and technologies are to us all. 06.03.02.06_Collective_working_protocols.This point we joined up together within TMUX, which is a terminal multiplexer. This sounds very complicated, but basically lets you work collaboratively within one terminal together and is used for collective server work. I wanted to bring this collaborative interface into focus as it does have many restraints and frictions for collaborative working. These range from basic things like classic obscure terminal copy and paste commands, but also that there is only one person able to write at one time, and the possibility of accidentally loosing sessions by typing exit (even in another command). In the pad and session though the reflections focus mainly on technical elements of TMUX as the limits above gave us a few technical issues members couldn't quite get beyond. We were also running a little out of time so decided to move on from this and to focus on writing the manifesto together. Reflecting on this brief contact though, it was interesting to see how collaboration in these technologies is configured through very restrictive relations, and when a group like us, who collaborate in a number of dynamics and approaches, found this pre-configured relation too tight and misfitting to our needs. In-grid was definitely not the imagined expert users of TMUX, but being in touch with these constrained collaborative environments showed us how much these relations needed us to form wiggle room within them.\n06.03.02.07_Manifesting_Femfester<br>Emerging out of this foreground and the workshop's wiggling of room in these technical protocols we turned our attention to the collective writing of our initial Manifesto for this server. To do this we talked as a group about how we wanted to orient our approach to this. To start this off In-grid members chatted about what the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant, 2015) meant to them, and what they thought of it, with members being excited for us to take on iterating our own version as it had been an inspiration to members of the group. We decided that a collective reading of the original Feminist Server Manifesto would be a nice way to initiate this, and then follow it up by commenting on, iterating through and figuring out our own manifesting of it. In this reading we took turns to read lines in non-hierarchical and improvised form with members dynamically taking up where others left off, and echoing back to earlier collective reading practices and performances In-grid has done<a data-footref=\"59\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fn-1-a70e71b06899dc83_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.We followed this up by doing another In-grid practice of synchronous free writing in a shared pad. This is a practice we have emerged that makes room for members to anonymously let ideas and thoughts out, making it a very relaxed way to start ideation and get a feel of how the group is oriented. After this free writing we started to form alignments with the manifesto by writing out the original lines, talking through them and figuring out how \"our lines\" oriented from theirs. We only had time to go through half of them in the session, as people had time constraints, but here again we were in-flex-able around this. To do this we turned to an a-sync work flow where we wrote on the etherpad and online. Through this process of reorienting the manifesto and feeling out a few points where we wiggled from their path. Here we re-oriented many of these issues through critiques and figures of access, asking how we as a group can imagine and materialise these approaches in our network practices. This ranged from caring for the frictions of accessing a server collectively, to making room for those difficulties to be knowable and accessible by others. In this orientation we formed our own impact centred critical access informed dialogues and practices that disoriented \"transparency\". In-grid's central figure of reorientation of this emerged from our dedication to interdependence as a pivotal to our manifesting. The original Feminist Server manifesto does clearly come from community and a place of interdependence, but we wanted to emphasise interdependence as the figure that made room for In-grid's manifesting. In this move we also reoriented from not apologising for not being available (all the time), to learning to communicate our capacities and feel out and take care around our limits, both individual/collective. This for me also opens this manifesting to being a practice that changes over time, and one that aims to not only reveal but also build up our capacities within relation. We did in many places not wiggle from the original manifestos path though, finding alignment in the refusal of security, of exposing insecurities and avoiding ease-of-use. Again though we found it important to reaffirm these moves through abolitionist concepts and wordings. Over the next week or two we worked together asynchronously to edit and finesse together this manifesto, along with a short intro, for publication with Servus and the first edition of their Artists Running Datacentres journal (Davide Bevilacqua, 2024). Here it was engulfed in a further plurality of research, interviews and practitioner knowledges from across Servus' community. This manifesto aligns with the provocation of the original Feminist sever manifesto (ibid), as well as with this researches approach of flawed and crazed crip manifesting (Kafer, 2017, 2023). This is where in its essence, the Femfester not only makes space for itself to be more crazed, poetic and visceral but also yearns to be iterated through its misfitting in action, and frictions made and felt within complex systems and configurations of community infrastructures. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#fnref-1-a70e71b06899dc83_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 06.04.00_In-reflection<br>In reflecting on our <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a>, our development of accessible doc practices, to make room for Serv(er)ing In-grid by Practicing Protocols to Femfester together our first server manifesto in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.00_configure-ability_in-.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-</a> section, I aimed to offer up how configure-able methods can make room within relations for the flexibility our collective and communal bodies need and orient towards within our sociotechnical infrastructures. This entangle set of inquiries made room for In-grid (and I) to take configure-able methods up and to not only practice but also process and configure out locally the manifestation of our collective infrastructures. Reflecting more closely on the outcomes of the multitude of outcomes, I think it worked well as a method to wiggle room within these technical practices through critical access informed disobedient collective interventions of expertise. In-grid here taking our sweet time to form collective imaginaries from our background and through these direct actions. With these actions making room for our embodied situated knowledges as a group to disorient how we want to configure these social and technical reltions of network infrastructure and collective organising from their sites of impact. For me these inquiries into in-configure-ability, it has emerged as a methodology and practice for In-grid to challenge the norms and sedimented relations of security politics we have inherited through our own disobedient politics and figures of collective access. To do this we retreated from these norms and turned to social practices of forming community trust, interdependence and care. With this movement we aimed to retreat from the myths and figures of security and transparency, to instead orient to that of critical access as a way to distribute the knowing and expertise throughout a group, instead of having it transparently figured out for them.\npandoc_orderinput-files:\n./06.00_Intro.md\n./06.01.00_Background.md\n./06.02.00_Processing

Here though I want to surface how in collaboration with In-grid, and with my critical input from this research we collectively tried to query the norms of technical practice, and their docs through critical access. By taking up critical access here we are both asking how can we make room for these practices and their knowledges to be more accessible to wider groups and dialogues through the ways we describe and format this information, but also how this can make space for people to dispute, unsediment and disorient together the network infrastructures we have inherited.<br>Carrying on the framing from the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a> section, where In-grid orients approaching systemic inflexibility through our collective practice of In-flex-ability, I share how we have started to make room around these norms.06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-DocsIn this Chapter I reflect on the intersectional inquiry I undertook into Configure-Able methods as a member of In-grid. This inquiry builds out of In-grid's slowly sedimented collective practices and aims to highlight how through first person action research and disobedient action research methods I have introduced critical access as a critical framework and practice to reorient our ways of relating to and coalescing tables of social and technical infrastructure together. It specifically orients how we formed technical practices of collective access that disoriented the norms of expertise within our network and organisational practices and their knowledges. In this I aim to share how Crip theory and critical access doesn't have to be extra time or assimilationist, but can be a place to collectively orient from in the configuration of our communities and their infrastructures.<br>To do this I am following of from prior chapters forming of <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>, I aim to go beyond that initial \"definition\" and move to feel it out in action and through collective inquiry. I do this by initially setting a background for these figures to emerge from, acting as a ground for In-grid's practices to be contoured and figured out from. I then reflect on a focus group I organised for In-grid members that reflected on the longer arcs in our collective practices through a framing of critical access. Here I made room for us to figure out frictions in these experiences and in doing so questioning the inflexibilities of the systems we felt. Orienting from these points we questioned how we had formed wiggle room around or within these points of impact through In-flex-ability. This is a recurring word play from us, where In-grid get In- to all sorts of trouble. In-flex-ability as we go on to define through action is manifested through interdependence in action, and where we can make room together to distribute and move around these systemic pressures and frictions, aiming to move towards how we want to collectively orient ourselves. This framing of In-flex-ability is also meant to move these dialogues beyond the problem/solution axis of curative design practices, and instead focus on how In-grid address and orient towards not only validating our feeling around these existing frictions, but make room for that feeling as part of the sense making and figuring out processes of configuration.<br>Working through this framing, I reflect on In-grids collective inquiry, as well as my first person inquiry, into how we approached these systemic inflexibilities through our collective in-flex-abilities. These inquiries then go on to take into closer consideration the technical network practices we undertook together. This inquiry resulted in the forming of accessible technical for the Servpub and Tinc VPN that I reflect on in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.00_configure-ability_in-docs.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs</a>. From these we also emerged a set of workshops to make more space for these collective figuring out practices that we ran at 4S/EASST 2024 as well as internally, which I reflect on in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_configure-ability_in-workshops.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a>. From these In-flex-able technical network practise I reflect on the counter figures and configurations we manifested along the way, as well as the emergence into In-grid's first Feminist Server Manifesto, that we called Femfester and published with Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024). 06.00_IntroThis focus group is to reflect on In-grid's collective organisational methods through a framing of critical access. The focus will be accessible to member's reorientation but it will be a time for us to look back and reflect on how we have started to configure our own infrastructure and background away from big tech institutions and towards feminist and intersectional community infrastructures. In this reflection I hope for us to articulate together through processing our inquiry, a few figures (metaphors) of our own to make accessible these situated relations. To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflex when working socially and technically. These will form contours for us to reflect on how we have enabled our collaboration to be in-flex-able together. This interplay being the place we form figures and narratives of access from, and where we as a collaboration have flexed towards accessible futures and away from institutional inflex.\nGo over questions for G\nDefine together inflex and in-flex + qs to help us think through them.\nFeel out some topics or experiences to reflect on the inflex and then our in-flex-ability.\nWhat are the systematic and institutional relations that hold/held us in place? From Ahmed - lines holding norms of relations in place. + Aimi Hamraie Flexibile users and soft bodies being conformed to hard machines. Systemic issues around CAPITALISM aside. University structure, jobs/working relationships hold some elements in place, and enable certain actions. Institutions, these come with some privileges but academia/large institutions can be ableist, smaller grass roots organisations that are not driven by the logics of capitalism can enable alt spaces. How we stay attached to these institutions or stay with the difficulties of systemic issues, but find wiggle room, how we make wiggle room. All the other things, like race, class, gender etc etc etc Social and also contractual relationships Time = money under the jobbing job world. And collectivising means we can pool time or labour in a time-poor world.

Time, space, funding, prestige, brain space, emotional capacity Dumb systems that's difficult to work with (Ex: No bank options for non- profitable small collective) Working as a collective, that is not a business or a charity or an institution, makes it difficult to interface with other bodies.

It takes the crip approach of imperfect manfistings that take practice and care, in their imperfection form bodies on horizons to orient from/to together.Talking about my methodology of disobedient action-research. This focuses on action research that moves beyond the scales of institutions and derives from direct actions into forming relations, infrastructures and imaginaries together. It also routes itself within first person action research, forming dialogues that entangle internal feelings and politics, with external actions and relations.This is a mapping of an internal arc of the research, and starts to re-orient critical access and configuration methods by brining them into contact with each other. In bringing them into contact I aim to see what impression they make on each other and how we can rethink access as a relational configuration practice and configuration practices as material/political processes.<br>(Hamraie, 2017) - <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6\" target=\"_self\">https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6</a>.Writes about the formation of the figure of the user within industrial design and how this was formed from the understanding that human bodies are soft and malleable unlike machines, which are hard, determined and static things humans have to be shaped around.

Here thinking about how we can reflect through these methods to inquire into our own practices internally and externally.Q: how will data and anonymity be handed in the PhD in relation to any write-ups about institutions / relations to external groups? How can we be frank about discussions while also protecting the trust within the group? Do you have consent forms for us as individuals around how we’d like the names of ourselves and/or our affiliations named in any write-ups or storage of notes / transcripts? A: I have forms and information sheets I will share with you via email before the session which explain a lot of this. I also will share any writing up with you for approval esp if you are mentioned by name. All notes will be in this pad, but will also be stored in the cloud and held according to GDPR. In-fra_processing working padTo form the figures of this inquiry I will first start by forming the background for them to emerge from, and trace the long tail that builds up to contour these bodies. In-grid's background rises from our emergence during a collective residency run at Arebyte Gallery in 2020 at the start of the pandemic. This was run by Rachel Falconner, Helen Pritchard and Rabecca Edwards. During this residency a group of 10-20 of us formed a set of skill shares and collaborations with artists and technical practitioners across a number of fields. This was held mostly online, and focused on people's fluctuating capacities during a very stressful and unpredictable pandemic, forming a very specific relation for working. We often joke about how this has trauma bonded us together.Since the residency we kept communing together, talking and keeping in touch. It was a year or so later when the pandemic and lock down started to ease that we began to come back together and regularly work again. This was during the first year of my PhD and during this time we built up multiple collective events, forming distributed ways of working and facilitating outcomes together. These ranged from a series of club nights/events called Real Bodies beginning at Corsica nightclub, with many installed works and performances, to Chain at Iklectic where In-grid formed a preformative infrastructure that evolved over the night. Since then we have kept working together forming other exhibitions, infrastructures and skill shares collectively, as well as slowly establishing our internal organisation practices in the small bits of time we can be together.Over this time people have joined and left, so we have balanced out to be a core group of 5-8 people and max 10-15 who can join in and contribute where they want and are able. These blury numbers may seem odd but they are due to our open door policy, which makes rooms for members to come and go as they need. This structure has formed through us orienting to make space for those of limited capacities due to work, life or health, as well as our constant lack of (institutional) funding that is common in community/arts work in post austerity UK. We also have a wide range of disciplines, capacities and approaches, from musicians to web developers and community activists. This brings an eclectic set of goal and desires to the background of this group.<br>Another focus in this background is the 8M Trans*feminist counter cloud strike<a data-footref=\"t1\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-4f927ba00382d8e0_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> that we took a part of in 2021 and the years since with a number of different collectives in coalition. This meeting of many communities and collectives was also a major shift in In-grids desires and background. This strike focused on moving away from big tech ecologies and instead starting to invest our time, energy and resources into re-approaching how we can work with and for technical infrastructures towards our own collective orientation of them. These meetings formed the basis for our desire to not only question In-grid's own collective infrastructure but to also start to approach being in coalition with other communities.From this background I crop into two different scales of inquiry for this research. Within these inquiries and reflections I aim to both demonstrate Configure-Able Methods in action, and how they are localised within and emerge from In-grid's dynamic and intersectional background. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/8m/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-4f927ba00382d8e0_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n06.01.00_BackgroundThrough this collective inquiry and focus group In-grid together started to imagine and define In-flex-ability from our experiences as a way to form wiggle room around where we felt frictions within the sedimented norms of sociotechnical systems. In this reflection on our longer term organisational practice we surfaced how In-grid has actioned our network infrastructuring practices, our in-ternal politics and our practices of collaboration and knowledge exchange by making room within the limiting norms for our members to have flexibility within their approach to this collective practice. As a collective we also took up configure-able methods within these figures and relations to think about how we want to orient our collective body, and in which ways we can make flexibility within and around these hard systems and infrastructures. This ranged from even just acknowledging that some things are just out of reach, and openly stating how we wished we could orient ourselves, but also to taking direct actions within the spaces we do have agency, like the ways we relate to one another as well as the technologies we collaborate with and through. In-grid's orientation of in-flex-ability in action makes room for us to not only acknowledge the systemic inflexibility to work around them in situated and flexible ways, but also to acknowledge how these systems have made impressions on us, and how we have inflexibility in ourselves in the way we can come together or make room for the unknown-able other, within our social and technical plans and actions.This processing of In-configure-able methods and In-flex-able practice in action sets up the framing for the next section which takes a closer examination of how this has been collectively actioned in relation to network infrastructures, their technical docs, and the ways these practises and their knowledges are shared. In this collective inquiry giving depth to the understanding of both how Configure-able methods were manifested in this intersectional context.06.02.03.00_Defining_In-flex-abilityHere In-grid turned in-ward to frictions within how we as a group figure out and orient our own collective politics in practice. This focus offered us room to reflect on how we as a group form goals and orient towards them. In this dialogue we also made room to question what those goals currently are. It also has to be said that this was definitely the most fun topic to chat about, with lots of joy and giggles, when reflecting on these impact of these frictions and our resulting care for them.The inflexibility we felt here orients a number of matters. This is explicit when we question what is possible with limited funding, what we can squeeze in around work and what (if any) of our activities are understood as valid and valued within these systems. We also touched upon how we as students of these academic institutions, teachers and researchers within them, as well as within the norms of other computing/creative industries have inherited and sedimented the politics and norms of these bodies within us. Here we ask how these norms reinforce us to be inflexible in certain ways so that the contingent politics and relations we orient towards are out of reach. One example we experienced and raised around this came from both academic institutional norms, as well as ones of communities around us, and which oriented towards the ease of centring knowledge in individuals as it was more efficient than dispersing it into collective knowledges. This centring of practises and their knowledges though situates all the capacity to do certain things within certain people. Here by not taking on this troublesome task of distributing these practices and their knowledges the organisation can loose these capacities easily in doing so, through certain people leaving, becoming ill/mad/dissociative or passing. Beyond this consolidating these practices and their knowledges into an individual also takes them out of reach of others, and makes no room for them to know those practices and politics as a group, or the plurality knowings that makes room for.<br>In-response we reflected on how In-grid made room within and around these normalised institutionalised practices of management and collaboration that we have experienced. Becky and Katie surfaced a joke they have here about how if anyone needed to understand In-grid's methods and process, they should read the Simple Sabotage Field Manual (1944) by the CIA. This is not true in every way, we are not out to break our own things, like this manual suggest for taking down fascist states and their infrastructures. Instead when approaching collective practice In-grid is slow and we take our time, we are dedicated to working in large groups<a data-footref=\"t10\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-3c9a1eb797262649_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, have many misunderstandings<a data-footref=\"t11\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-3c9a1eb797262649_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and lots of emotions to share<a data-footref=\"t12\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-3c9a1eb797262649_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. These actions for us, and maybe because many in the manual were appropriated from anti-fascist, communist and anarchist movements are the many practices we have to come to decisions, build trust and get consensus from different members on our orientations. The many ways we orient this differently to the CIA manual of course is that the actions we take are done through love and care, where we aim to build up In-grid's relations, instead of weaponizing them. In many ways this shares how we do break down efficient management systems, but In-grids orients towards other ways of being together instead of replacing one fascist state with another. It is only through years of these relations building up that we have emerged the trust that makes room for members to take different approaches, forget what we were doing, and to be okay with being uncomfortable. For example getting our cloud setup moved to Servus took over a year to get everyone set up with account on it and for us to feel like we as a group knew what we are doing there. Still though there are some members who don't want to be on there and that is fine, and we have found ways to be in-flex-able around these points of friction so to not excluded them. In these ticing practices we build trust and patience in letting people manage their own way to reflect on and learn from our collective practices and their frictions. This demonstrates well our practice of in-flex-ability, and shares how we have wiggled room together within the sedimented and inherited norms for the flexibility In-grids member's need and manifest to be together within these inflexible systems and times. <br>\"Attempt to make the committees as large as possible - never less than five\" (CIA, 1944, p.&nbsp;28)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-3c9a1eb797262649_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Misunderstand\" orders.

This topic's scope focused on our long term retreat from the norms of hosting our collective infrastructures with big tech cloud, to instead orient towards community and artist run cloud. This movement started after we had joined the 8M communities mentioned in the background of the chapter. During this transition we have slowly moved from a scattering of big tech cloud services to a focused collaboration of our cloud and network infrastructures held with Servus.Some of the inflexibility and frictions we felt when moving out of and retreating from the norms of Big Tech network infrastructures were how as a product/service which is divided into user/designer relations, it meant that we felt defined to a specific role and body with no agency. To do this these Big Tech cloud infrastructures often put people out of reach of the matteriality of what they are using, and aim to keep the user experience, and the shaping of the human factor friction-less. To keep these infrastructures even more out of reach the sedimented norms and defaults of sysadmin and network maintenance is oriented as a burden, joyless and friction-full. It is also often only done by the isolated expert working alone or from a distance to configure technical relations for other users who are strangers to them.To form wiggle room here specifically we practised in-flex-ability through interdependence and collaboration. In this moving our scoping from needing to take on this immense burden that is out of reach of us, to instead ask what we have capacity do as In-grid, and what we can rely on others for. For instance, we as a group could not host our cloud infrastructures due to member capacity, experience and knowledges as well as a number of other reasons, so are working with Servus to host them. In this relation forming wiggle room around the frictionles user roles we were forced into by big tech and instead through the frictions of working with Servus, gently coming into contact with and making sense of the material frictions of network infrastructures, our needs within them and how we want to orient towards them. On an experimental server we have hosted with them we have started to form more wiggle room here by starting to host our own VPN and distributed network, as well as a git code repository (we are working towards). This orienting of scales, capacities and scope towards interdependence and coalition made room for us to not only move off of the big tech cloud, but also towards building up relations with similar communities and putting these capacities in reach of our collective futures. 06.02.02.01_De-re-cloudingFor this focus we reflected on how we as a collective have worked with others and exchanged knowledge, practices and built relations along the way. This work is very much emerging for In-grid, both in the sense that we are only just beginning to work with other collectives and communities but also in that we are starting to do more things and splinter off into smaller working groups. Both of these were places where we felt we needed to make room for feedback and exchange within the wider group for these practices and knowledges.The inflexibility and friction we felt here came from two points of impact. One was how we relates as a group and with others, and how these exchanges are handled. Here we reflected back to points where relations had induced anxiety and had a huge impact on our capacity for exchange. These for us often originated form relations where we felt like others were trying to catch people out, penalise them, or not open up relations on a personnel situated level without prescribing them to a role. This was mainly felt when working with other collaborators, but of course still existed internally. We felt that these sorts of sedimented relations of policing undermined not only our capacities to work together as we needed to constantly validate our position, but also our enthusiasm and energy for those collaborations. The other friction we return to is our lack of funding, and how this curtails our capacity to meet the many people and matters we have in relation with the intimacy we wish we could.To care for, feel out and wiggle room within these inflexibilities, In-grid reflected on how we try our softest to have patience and be generous with each other and other others. This for us meant taking time to share knowledge, make room to let it sink in, bringing clarity through repetition, not in a way to reinforce bodies and relations, but like a tic (Maier et al., 2020) when someone forgets or is lost we gently re-orient ourselves together. So when someones like \"why are we even bothering with banking/cloud/coalitions/being here it seems so much trouble\", we can again go over why we have chosen to put ourselves in awkward relations to practice in-flex-ability around these systemic Inflexibilities, but are doing this in a way that distributes and reforms these sedimented relations. It is when someone vulnerably turns up 2 months later and they need us to recap some of that time to be in-sync-ish. For In-grid it was also about figuring out ways of making these repetitions and in-flex-abilities joy-full even. This is still very much an ongoing dialogue and one where the many members of In-grid are slowly forming our own practices and politics that can refuse these penal norms we live among, and form wiggle room and social/systemic flexibility for people to bring their own ways of being together in our collaborations.06.02.02.02_Working groups and knowledge exchange<br>This section offers up a collective inquiry and reflection by In-grid around our longer term practices and where we processed together how Configure-able methods has manifested locally in our context. To do this I initiated a focus group and working session called In-fra processing to reflect back over these years of work together with In-grid members through the framing of Configure-able methods. This became a place for us to make room around/within and to trouble the frictions and inflexibilities we felt from our experiences of configuring these systems through our collective practices of Configure-Ability. This focus group was also run as part of the annual In-grid In-ternal residency to make room for us to query and reorient our approaches together as we went forward. This session was run as a very relaxed online call where we got together and took collective notes and reflections on this <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Infra_processing\" target=\"_self\">pad</a>. Here we initially started by figuring out some of the inflexibility we had felt in practice and from them recollected our collective practices of in-flex-ability in practise. Doing this we aimed to frame our configure-able methods and practices of in-flex-ability by making-sense of how we approached and reoriented the norms of these relations we came in contact with.06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-abilityWhen it came to defining In-flex-ability in a similar way, and where I had prepared some prompts and questions, we instead decided to orient to figuring it out in inquire and action. Here we reflected on how we improvised other ways of approaching these places of friction within the sedimented norms we felt friction with. As a group we decided on which practice's frictions and misfittings we wanted to orient from and in which ways we wanted to approach them. This resulted in us making sense of in-flex-ability by reflecting on the inflexibilty we felt in our processes and practices of De/re-clouding, Coalition and knowledge exchange and our In-ternal politics. When doing these it took us a minute to warm up to this framing of inflexibility/in-flex-ability, but through this emerged some interesting points of collective reflection.06.02.02.00_Figuring_out_In-flex-abilityIn questioning the horizon of these sedimented norms and the inflexibility we had felt both in the inherited configurations of technical docs as well as the social relations of how they were shared in practice, we wanted to make room to care for these frictions. To do this we coalesced these practices towards In-grid's own background and promise of collective access. The sub working group of In-grid members met many times together over on greenhost jitsi video calls as we often do to have collective dialogue. Together here we reflected on how we wanted to enact these practices, thinking about what structures and formats made room for this information to be understood and configured otherwise by us.By making wiggle room within these constrained practices, we made room for them to be flexible towards our ways of working and politics. Here we were also keen to inquire how we could form wiggle room for others to disorient and configure out these docs otherwise for them selves. In this move we wanted to question the expertise and knowledge within these systems, moving it from the isolated and determinate super users to chaotic collective in practice. In this motion bring a plurality of bodies into contact with these infrastructure to make sense of them from many points of impact, friction and knowing. This approach aiming to not just disorient the compliant technical expert and designer but to make room for the figure of a disobedient user who brings with them their community and context.06.03.01.02.00_in-flex-ability<br>Here I initiate this inquiry by examining the inflexibilities we found both within the social and technical aspects when making the docs for the Servpub infrastructure. When the sub working team of In-grid<a data-footref=\"r2\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> initially tried to figure out the practices necessary for the Servpub infrastructure from other communities within the collaboration and the official docs of the VPN (Tinc<a data-footref=\"1s\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>), we found it inaccessible and full of barriers for a few reasons. We are a group of fairly technically capable people, and even though this was a new technical practice for us, it was hard to get to grips with what was going on at this table of network infrastructures. In reflection this was in many places due to the technical documentation and resources we were recommended, and which were quite abstract or incomplete. Beyond this the time/capacity In-grid had was very limited as it was mostly voluntary work at this stage and so it was a struggle to reach this dictated outcomes. The workshops and working sessions explaining the practice were also intensive and long sessions of terminal/console work, which often over ran, leaving everyone tired, discombobulated and unable to document or remember what had happened clearly. The formats of both felt fairly pre-configured and very rigid and did not make space for In-grid to have agency or input our background, approaches and ways of working around these sorts of frictions. Instead we were told \"why can't we be like others\", aka be quite and listen to/reproduce the \"one best way\" of feminist server practices.<br>Looking closer at the materiality of sysadmin as a technical process and practice it is quite specific in the ways it is made to be knowable. This practice for me personally has taken time to firstly understand and get used to the how the terminal environment works, finding handy commands, short keys and approaches that are absent from the very minimal void of an interface. The norms for this sort of terminal based sysadmin practice from my experience are written technical documentation which aim to act as references while you work. As part of our practice into this environment we started to make our own technical docs and as we came into contact with this practice, we started to question the norms of these sedimented approaches to configuring network infrastructures. From these sites of impact we questioned how these doc's formats made these practices know-able and perform-able in very specific ways and by specific people. Technical docs normally take on the form of text and code intervals, which often procedurally get you to run commands, whilst giving you little background knowledge into what is being done or why. A fine example of this is from an institution is Google's documentation on accessible web practices<a data-footref=\"2s\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, here they share does and don'ts, technical practices and share other resources that do help to make a more accessible web resource, but also mitigate any of the history or reasons for why. Their bland initiating statement \"We write our developer documentation with accessibility in mind\", orients from the start that they do not centre the impacts of access, and in doing so overrule the generative capacities these frictions would make there. When it came to the docs of Tinc<a data-footref=\"3p\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-4-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, the VPN we used, they are even less descriptive and just have code functions and commands abstractly explained in technical language and figures which are inaccessible to non-expert practitioners. Tinc's background and introductory information<a data-footref=\"1c\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-5-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> also isolates the scoping to what needs to be known to setup a VPN with Tinc, and gives little reason as to clearly state the orientation of this infrastructures social and political background. Reflecting on Tinc's docs through Hamraie's flexible user (2017), I understood these norms of technical docs as highly inflexible and were figured and shaped for a particular body of the expert/super user, that not many of In-grid would fit without friction. The norms of these formats and the expected users they make room for hold an inflexible promise or set of (political) intentions of a specific setup, pipeline or approach towards network infrastructuring. Being procedural dictating formats they prescribed expertise to specific relations, politics and figures for others to manifest their infrastructure through. Working with these standardised configurations of infrastructures can be understood as taking on the determined roles and operational metaphors of a system without capacity to question them, or be given space to localise, improvise and reinterpret them to local relations, desires and needs. To me this made me reflect on the ways that Miriyam Aouragh and Paula Chakravartty in Infrastructures of Empire (2016) discuss how infrastructures bring with them and reinforce the politics of the creator, and with this there is a need to question these inherited norms and make room for this locality when manifesting them. These norms of docs and their technical practices hold these infrastructures in space, in line and for most out of reach.Another key inflexibility of the Serpub infrastructure and these docs was the maintainability of its setup. This setup was predominantly based around the use of Tinc, which even though a relativley accessible VPN (compared to others) and one that comes from a genealogy of autonomous feminist servers, was becoming deprecated. This meant in many ways that any infrastructure based on these docs would (even if maintained) become obsolete, insecure and dysfunctional. This restraint to maintenance and deprecation crosses into all docs and infrastructures, but here provides a point of contact and friction to question how we would, with limited resources care for this technical infrastructural rot, and try to maintain the collective practices that go beyond them. <br>Katie Tindle, Batool Desouky, Sunni Lao, Rebecca Aston + Me.<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-2-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility\" target=\"_self\">https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-3-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Controlling-tinc.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-4-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html\" target=\"_self\">https://tinc-vpn.org/documentation-1.1/Introduction.html</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-5-c64b548d4734c231_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n06.03.01.01_InflexibilityThese next two sections take on a closer inquiry into how Configure-able methods have emerged through In-grid's network infrastructuring practices. Our enactment of the methods here approach how these technical practices and their knowledges are shared. I initially approach this inquiry through first person action research reflections around our collective technical and documentation practices. I then follow this up with a in-ternal In-grid workshop as an example of how these methods have manifested both accessible social and technical practises to make room for groups to disorient and figure out network infrastructure as we configure them.06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-<br>When reflecting on the frictions that emerged when we configured out these infrastructures we contemplated how to make wiggle room for the dialogues we had together. These processes and practices of making space to reflect on what is being done and how, comes both from the emerging internally methods of In-grid, but have also had an impression made on them when being in contact with other collectives of Servpub collaboration such as Creative Crowds and SysterServer. It also builds up with Hamraie's notion of \"design friction\"(2023), centring those at the site of impact to re-imagine, redesign and reconfigure the infrastructures and systems they are in touch with. Through these approaches we dedicated time to caring for, feeling out and inquiring into the figures we encountered together within the configurations of these infrastructures. This for me personally was the likes of rubbing up against Tinc's logo (+@fig:tincLogo), an Apache attack helicopter, and being reminded of Isabel Waidner's We are made of diamond stuff, where the narrator questions the US military naming practices (2019, pp.&nbsp;18-23). This is where \"They use words as weapons, they use weapons as weapons, and sometimes both come together in the Boeing CH-47 Chinook\"(ibid, pp.&nbsp;22), but also in the case of Tinc and it's Apache logo, how private networks are often conflated with and depicted through militaristic violence and colonial dominance. With a decolonial crip approach I would also understand with Hamraie's crip technoscience<a data-footref=\"51\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-d8c906f94c76b155_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, and actioning how we can start to retreat these technical and social networks of privacy away from these sedimented roots of militaristic and colonial violence through community actions of access.<br><img alt=\"Tinc logo which shows a grey scale Apache attach helicopter behind tinc written in lower case black writing\" src=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_media/image1.png\" target=\"_self\">{#fig:tincLogo}In action and as a group we also found members being lost from graphviz diagrams, maps and representations of this closed VPN network and leaving them unable to help maintain or know these infrastructures easily. This was mainly due to Tinc being both hard to access across In-grid member's variety of operating systems (OS), as well as not much time given by mentors to access Tinc from non-linux systems. As In-grid we had to find hacks and improvisations to work together around these limits, for example using Linux terminals on another OS. There was also the for ever forgotten passwords for the for ever layers of security that these zero trust network norms of domination entail, and which we were not used to accessing. Working within Servpub we also encountered more poetic, symbolic and figural naming practices of computational systems which made wiggle room within them to re-orient these systems througha background of feminist histories, language and variability. These configurings out in practice are often impossible to portray through not only a static set of technical docs, but also essays like this here. They are about knowing through practice, and by taking actions within and around the materiality of these technical and social infrastructural relations and to feel their impact on your body. Instead of trying to cure these inevitable gap between theory and practise, In-grid oriented towards developing workshops for people to practise these docs and network practices through configure-able methods for themselves. When an opportunity arose for us to share this work at 4S/EASST 2024 in Amsterdam, we went about thinking how to formulate these practices into the first iteration of our workshop called Practising Protocols. This workshop accompanied a panel we organised and brought together with other members of community groups and collectives organising community infrastructures, some from the 8M strike. This included Donna Halford-Lovell from NEoN Digitial presenting their community work around digital access, Julia Nueno presenting her work with app delivery driver communities forming counter apps to unionise and empower with, Femke Snelting from TITiPI sharing their Counter cloud imaginaries, tactics and stickers, as well as members of SHAPE talking about their work.<br>Bringing the docs into contact with this plurality of community politics, imaginaries, and practice, also provoked us further to make wiggle room for these collective differences of context, needs and sensitivity in these practising protocols workshops. The name of practising protocols itself emerges from both its feminist STS roots, but also through a crip understanding of protocols as a place to dispute expert knowledged of systems through counter protocols<a data-footref=\"52\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-d8c906f94c76b155_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. In doing this we thought of how to trouble the centralised and procedural practices of infrastructures through making more room within the practices they emerge from to localise and situate this knowledge and expertise with that of the working group.<br>For this initial workshop at 4S/EASST we decided to crop in to the docs to a very basic process of getting into one of the Servpub autonomous servers and collectively editing a html file that was being served online. This HTML would then hold the collective protocols we made during this workshop. We did this as this conference has attendance from a mixture of backgrounds, but is predominantly not a technical expert space. This setting offered us room to test what it meant to make these technical docs and their practices configure-able to people of these varying backgrounds, capacities and expriences. Within these steps of, sshing into the server, entering TMUX<a data-footref=\"57\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-d8c906f94c76b155_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, editing a HTML doc in Nano<a data-footref=\"58\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-4-d8c906f94c76b155_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, and exiting the admin session together, we made room and took our time to question what we came into contact with, felt friction around and wanted to configure out otherwise together. This iteration and context gave us great feedback for how to run these workshops, with the final outcomes published publicly on the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://ci.servpub.net/in-grid/collective-infrastructures\" target=\"_self\">panel blog</a> and within the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://servpub.net/ci_protocols.html\" target=\"_self\">html doc</a> we edited live together. From this initial iteration of the workshop we felt like Practising Protocols were a promising way of making room for groups to configuring out infrastructures together through an accessible process that made room for their embodied sense-making and expertise. In this iteration and workshop session it made space for us to emerge with the group a dialogue around how these practices and processes were pre-configured and imagined through specific logics of servitude, users and bodily relations, and ones where we as a group could start to discuss and form our own paths and orientation within, around and/or away from them.This workshop and panel combined worked well to make room for accessibly dialogues around the technical imaginaries and configuration practices of network infrastructures and collective organising. It formed a context where In-grid and participants could question how communities and collectives come together to form their own approaches, relations and figures locally. It was also a fairly radical to do this with a panel of \"experts\", that was run by a trans*feminist collective, and with participants from digital arts charities, union organising and radical counter cloud imaginaries at 4S/EASST. This could also be said for the accompanying workshop that made room for conference members to not only access the terminal and technical network practices together, but to disorient them into a social dialogue in which we configured out these technical practices in action together!It was also interesting to reflect on how radically different the points of friction and reflection were in this workshop at 4S/EASST, compared to the next iteration with In-grid. This was of course because it was with different people in a different contexts and with slightly altered content. Still though it also shows to me the generative capacity the Practicing Protocols workshops have for disorienting the norms of network configurations by making room for divergent and situated dialogues that bring technologies in touch with and reverberating from the bodies they impact. <br>\"A crip technoscience theoretical framework builds on feminist and decolonial technosciences to differentiate between technologies developed through models of disability- as- pathology (often in the name of rehabilitating injured soldiers) and those derived from dis-ability culture communities, where technology supports embodied differences and interdependent socialities.\" (Hamraie, 2023, p. 308)<a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-d8c906f94c76b155_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"The feminist STS concept of “protocol” (Murphy 2012) describes methodological practices that become both standardized and reiterated in pursuit of particular politi cal goals.

This chapter by Acton poses how to approach language, structuring and formating to re-configure them into more accessible plain language. This is not meant as a a reduction of what is there but a reinterpretation of how we represent, translate and figure these relations and dynamics to/with others in accessible forms. It is also meant as a way to open up different discourses, such as technical ones like these, to be within reach of the disabled community. In this approach challenging the scope of what disabled people (and others) can have expertise around, access to and intimacy with. Here informed by her concept we actioned this inquiry by firstly being conscious of Acton's principles<a data-footref=\"53\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-314dd04b75e639fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> but also thinking through how we can localise this dialogue into technical docs and our own capacities. To do this I turned to Acton's plain language version of Alice Wong's anthology of essays called Disability Intimacy (2024), which informed us how to orient towards plain language. We situated these alongside the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)<a data-footref=\"54\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-314dd04b75e639fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> to think about how a Plain -ish Language WCAG (P-ish-LWCAG) might be oriented.With this in focus In-grid started to reconfigure the limits of docs by trying to make room within their norms for docs to be improvisable and knowable by different capacities and approaches. One way we did this was by making more room in the introductory sections of docs to hold more information about the background of these infrastructures, and discussing what these technologies are and why we are using them in this infrastructure. We also made sure to take care of and cover the technical elements that the norms of docs from our experience would brushed over or straighten out. With this metaphorical curb cut in the introductions to sections, we aimed to form ways in for people to relate to these practices who had divergent backgrounds to the ones where these technical procedures had emerged from. In doing this we made room for bodies which did not fit that of a normid super user or expert and instead highlighted this misfitting, its frictions and points of contact as generative sites for that body to re-imagine and reconfigure these social and technical infrastructures. Through this approach we also emerged our own syntax and formats for clearly signing both links and technical code elements. For links this oriented going beyond descriptive links to give extra short descriptions below them for people to get a better idea of what lay beyond. For the code inserts we started to form our own standards of how to make the technical syntax docs encoded more legible and improvisable. To do this in code exerts we highlighted &lt;variables&gt; with these brackets, and followed this up with how we had run them ourselves. There is an example quoted below. We did this to also emphasise the readers capacity to improvise and adapt these practices to the persons own local context. With this trying to make room to run them as non-procedural practices which do not orient them to a specific user and determined technical infrastructure. In this motion troubling the procedural deterministic norms of docs to instead make room for people to access these practices and knowledges through divergent disorienting dialogues.\n\"Syntax: sudo tinc -n &lt;NETNAME&gt; init &lt;NODENAME&gt;\nSo we did: sudo tinc -n systerserver init servpub\"\n(In-grid, 2025)\n<br>Towards the end of writing the docs we also found through extended networks outside of Servpub of an earlier documentation from the XPUB docs<a data-footref=\"55\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-314dd04b75e639fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a> as well as Lurk's RUN YOUR OWN<a data-footref=\"56\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-4-314dd04b75e639fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>, that the VPN parts of the Servpub infrastructure were based on. These clearly showed how to setup these systems and would have saved us lots of time configuring out these infrastructures. It would have been sensible to follow the efficient \"Don't repeat yourself\" (DRY) mantra of course, but in some ways this repetition, or what Get the frac in (Maier et al., 2020) might explain as a \"Tic\", lead us to repeat the same stuff but maybe as plain-ish stuff. At this later stage we were also facing the fact that the VPN elements of these docs (TINC) were becoming deprecated. Feeling the impact of both of these frictions we decided to reorient again from the norms of docs being an active site to pose these docs as more of an archive documenting and make knowable this infrastructure's background. This is displayed well within the VPN with Tinc page<a data-footref=\"1w\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-5-314dd04b75e639fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[5]</a> where we formed wiggle room within these docs for the histories and genealogies of infrastructures, and to share how different collective bodies, relations and practice can manifest and disorient these normalised infrastructures when they have brought them within reach. <br>\"Note on writing: This chapter is written in what I call a semi- plain language style.

With these questions around inflexibility we touched upon many different aspects of what this term could offer to us. One of the major points of disorientation within our dialogues and definition of inflexibility was when I brought crip studies into this conversation. This was after members of In-grid joked about capitalism being the ultimate inflexibility, forcing our bodies into uncomfortable and unwanted orientations just to get by. In response I agreed, bringing this jest into focus with crip studies opening up the ways it critiques capitalism's invalidation of bodies and matters through dialogues of productivity, value and normalisation. From this opening up of crip studies and critical access, we very much overflowed with experiences and critiques of the frictions we had felt together. One clear example we touched upon from reflecting on In-grids collective organisational practice is how banking systems make no room for organisations like us, yet we need a bank to work legally and be valid. This dynamic in practice left us not only with a very limited choice of one bank to work with, but the one that remained did not really match our politics. This process of getting that misfitting bank also took us months to sort out through their dysfunctional admin system, and our part-time non-expertise capacities. Here we made sense of these frictions and how these systems had taken us from how we wished we could orient ourselves (e.g. having easy flow of funds held by an ethical source) to the inflexible position of having a glitchy bank account profiteered off by unethical businesses.One point of friction around the definition of inflex came from whether restraints we put on ourselves could be understood as inflexibility. For example whether us keeping accountable to one another, taking our time and refusing certain relations or politics would be us being inflexible. Here I turned us again to this relational critique of access from crip studies, where the \"problem\" is not held in our individual bodies or needs being met, but rather in the social and systemic relations of politics that limit our ability to reach our needs that could otherwise be possible. With this notion inflexibility is positioned within the systems and their relations, in it needing us to perform specific roles (users), and with specific bodily figures and horizons (normids), to be able to be valid and approachable on their sedimented often inaccessible line. Reflecting on this later on though we do touch upon how In-grid, as our members work in institutes and were taught by them, have these systems and politics embedded in us, and how we have tried to make room to work through these frictions we feel in ourselves. 06.02.01.00_Figuring_out_Inflexibility&lt;div id=\"banner\"&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:00_Contents#Index_of_Sections\"&gt;\n&lt;img src=\"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/03_In-Grid/In-Docs/media/W4P_logo.png\"/&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n<br><img alt=\"A diagram of the Servpub network infrastructure made by In-grid.\" src=\"08_practice/03_in-grid/in-docs/media/docs-infrastructure-diagram.jpeg\" target=\"_self\">A diagram of the Servpub network infrastructure made by In-grid.These docs offer up and share the processes and technical practices that made up the back-end of the Servpub network infrastructure.

This is the first point that we came into contact with the server, and SSH configures the way we can connect, interface and be intimate with our server. There is little written feedback in the workshop notes on the pad, apart from \"1. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\". This is partially as we were still warming into collective note taking, but this note leads from a conversation we had about the embedded metaphor and figure of SSH as a hand shake. Within this conversation we opened up dialogues around the figures we want to replace. Instead of a handshake which reinforces able bodiedness within a normid user and with that the hierarchical relation and inaccessible contract making between particular kinds of bodies (white men). Here we started to imagine what metaphors we wanted to configure our relations to our infrastructure through. This particular friction did not generate any outcomes of counter figures, unlike others latter on, as I feel we may have still been warming into the process. It did though open up this dialogue of how we wanted to move towards other figures of our own. We wanted to find a practice and relation where we do not negate or hide these histories in our retreat from them, but disorient their bodies and relations through the impression of our retreat.06.03.02.02_SSH_protocolsOnce logged in to the server through SSH we reached Sudo, which is the command \"super user do\". This is needed to do most of the admin tasks on a server as it gives you the rights to do so. Here we found friction with this sort of responsibility and expertise being individualised to specific \"super\" users and that imagined body. In response to this we turned to orient around interdependence as a way to not only slow each other down and see things from a number of perspectives but to hold each other response-able through our distributed expertise. We also questioned how we could do this, asking questions like \"can we track who is doing what as sudo?\" Instead in conversation In-grid turned to questions of how we as a group could not formalise trust through security, tracking, etc., but through social technologies of interdependence, moving to further build trust between us socially, instead of solely through our technical systems.06.03.02.03_Sudo_protocolsThis room was made at the beginning of the workshop and before we started the technical parts of workshop to make space for us to reflect on and propose our codes of conduct together before we encode our social and technical infrastructures through them. We questioned how we desired to work together on this server and what relations we imagined and planned for ourselves. Here we focused on interdependence, on doing things in pairs, keeping people in-sync and making room for a-sync processes. We also focused on working slowly, being soft, and double, no triple checking before we do things. There was also a focus on documentation, not only as a way of keeping people in-sync, but also as a way to roll back or undo decisions and actions (where possible).06.03.02.01_Coding_protocols<br>This femfester is In-grid’s iteration of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" target=\"_self\">feminist server manifesto</a>. As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server.

This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.New things: Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment\nDoes not police language, but reads intentions and actionsForm different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from.

What is the difference between accessibility and transparency?

These user accounts are the ones that each of us access the server through and as a configuration orients the singular standardised individualised user on a device. Here was a very generative space for forming our own counter figures and found much joy in configuring ourselves, our roles and how we wanted to relate to each other on this server. In the reflective room around this point of contact we opened up a dialogue of how we desired to disorient the norms and sedimented relations that the figure of the User represents. Instead of users, which pull from eugenics histories and imagine a particular normid body (Hamraie, 2017), and servers, which emerge from traditions of hidding labour (Krajewski &amp; Iurascu, 2018), collectively we started to imagine how we wanted to orient our relations in this room. To figure this out we spent time chatting and writing up these imagined roles together. This configure-able room around roles emerged them within In-grid's locality as maintainers, carers and caretakers of this infrastructure, but also personas, players and characters. These all also oriented towards this server and our infrastructure being a collaborator in our collective, moving it from a normalised user/using hidden servers relationship, to one oriented towards mutual care. This is highlighted within the middle of the notes in the comment \"it is nice to be individuals in a collective\". This is where we reflected on the bounds of these individual users and the server they are situated on merge, but also where the individual or user inside/outside of and around a collective or infrastructure can offer us other imaginaries of how our relations might be configure-able to their locality.06.03.02.04_User_Protocols<br>Emerging out of this foreground and the workshop's wiggling of room in these technical protocols we turned our attention to the collective writing of our initial Manifesto for this server. To do this we talked as a group about how we wanted to orient our approach to this. To start this off In-grid members chatted about what the Feminist Server Manifesto (Constant, 2015) meant to them, and what they thought of it, with members being excited for us to take on iterating our own version as it had been an inspiration to members of the group. We decided that a collective reading of the original Feminist Server Manifesto would be a nice way to initiate this, and then follow it up by commenting on, iterating through and figuring out our own manifesting of it. In this reading we took turns to read lines in non-hierarchical and improvised form with members dynamically taking up where others left off, and echoing back to earlier collective reading practices and performances In-grid has done<a data-footref=\"59\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-33c218df6617791c_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>.We followed this up by doing another In-grid practice of synchronous free writing in a shared pad. This is a practice we have emerged that makes room for members to anonymously let ideas and thoughts out, making it a very relaxed way to start ideation and get a feel of how the group is oriented. After this free writing we started to form alignments with the manifesto by writing out the original lines, talking through them and figuring out how \"our lines\" oriented from theirs. We only had time to go through half of them in the session, as people had time constraints, but here again we were in-flex-able around this. To do this we turned to an a-sync work flow where we wrote on the etherpad and online. Through this process of reorienting the manifesto and feeling out a few points where we wiggled from their path. Here we re-oriented many of these issues through critiques and figures of access, asking how we as a group can imagine and materialise these approaches in our network practices. This ranged from caring for the frictions of accessing a server collectively, to making room for those difficulties to be knowable and accessible by others. In this orientation we formed our own impact centred critical access informed dialogues and practices that disoriented \"transparency\". In-grid's central figure of reorientation of this emerged from our dedication to interdependence as a pivotal to our manifesting. The original Feminist Server manifesto does clearly come from community and a place of interdependence, but we wanted to emphasise interdependence as the figure that made room for In-grid's manifesting. In this move we also reoriented from not apologising for not being available (all the time), to learning to communicate our capacities and feel out and take care around our limits, both individual/collective. This for me also opens this manifesting to being a practice that changes over time, and one that aims to not only reveal but also build up our capacities within relation. We did in many places not wiggle from the original manifestos path though, finding alignment in the refusal of security, of exposing insecurities and avoiding ease-of-use. Again though we found it important to reaffirm these moves through abolitionist concepts and wordings. Over the next week or two we worked together asynchronously to edit and finesse together this manifesto, along with a short intro, for publication with Servus and the first edition of their Artists Running Datacentres journal (Davide Bevilacqua, 2024). Here it was engulfed in a further plurality of research, interviews and practitioner knowledges from across Servus' community. This manifesto aligns with the provocation of the original Feminist sever manifesto (ibid), as well as with this researches approach of flawed and crazed crip manifesting (Kafer, 2017, 2023). This is where in its essence, the Femfester not only makes space for itself to be more crazed, poetic and visceral but also yearns to be iterated through its misfitting in action, and frictions made and felt within complex systems and configurations of community infrastructures. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.in-grid.io/projects/residency-event-maggie-roberts/</a><a href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-33c218df6617791c_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n06.03.02.07_Manifesting_FemfesterThis point we joined up together within TMUX, which is a terminal multiplexer. This sounds very complicated, but basically lets you work collaboratively within one terminal together and is used for collective server work. I wanted to bring this collaborative interface into focus as it does have many restraints and frictions for collaborative working. These range from basic things like classic obscure terminal copy and paste commands, but also that there is only one person able to write at one time, and the possibility of accidentally loosing sessions by typing exit (even in another command). In the pad and session though the reflections focus mainly on technical elements of TMUX as the limits above gave us a few technical issues members couldn't quite get beyond. We were also running a little out of time so decided to move on from this and to focus on writing the manifesto together. Reflecting on this brief contact though, it was interesting to see how collaboration in these technologies is configured through very restrictive relations, and when a group like us, who collaborate in a number of dynamics and approaches, found this pre-configured relation too tight and misfitting to our needs. In-grid was definitely not the imagined expert users of TMUX, but being in touch with these constrained collaborative environments showed us how much these relations needed us to form wiggle room within them.06.03.02.06_Collective_working_protocols.This wriggle room for reflection was made when members uploaded their SSH keys to their user (carer/maintainer/character/collaborator/persona) account so that we could turned off password access. This meant that only a person on a device with that key and its password can access that user on that server, making it \"secure\". This is the standard or \"norm\" of security for a server with a public IP like this, and realistically does keep this space \"safe\" within the materialised military imaginaries of a zero trust encryted web that we exist in today (Spencer &amp; Pizio, 2024). This relation became a place we found friction within these infrastructural inflexibilities that left In-grid asking what other imaginaries of safety and privacy could we imprint on our server from our background. Here I think influenced by the feminist server manifesto we talked a lot about transparency. We discussed how transparency even though performs the making visible of dynamics, is in many ways a barrier in place that is there to make a system \"secure\" from intervention. In this performance of transparency is also the filtering and orienting of these material practices and their background into the abstract languages and representative figures that form the knowledge of experts. Instead we started to ask how we could disorient these sedimented relations of security and transparency through critical access. In our notes this is highlighted by the desire to not \"ring-fence around particular roles\" or their knowledges, and the need to not have \"knowledge lie with one person\". With these statements refusing this figure of the expert user, and orienting to community and collective knowledges. To do this we thought about how safety for us is not about static barriers of security or hierarchical roles that reinforce each other, but to be intimate with who we are with and what we are doing. From this discussion our safety comes then not from a checklist, keys charters or generalised deterministic set of conditions, but from taking time to build trust by making room for each other to form dialogues and exchanges in-flex-able ways. Within network practices this was particularly relevant, as we did not want each other to be intimidated (by the already intimidating technology), so forming relations of trust that centred access of these technologies was key. We came up with many protocols and practices for achieving this, from again working in pairs/groups, researching/checking/quadruple-checking before we took actions, and collectively demystifying these systems to all be experts on what these protocols and technologies are to us all. 06.03.02.05_Digital_safe_space_protocols<br>I am bringing into focus here an iteration of these Practising Protocols workshops, which emerged from the aforementioned long tail of in-flex-able inquiries into <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.01.00_configure-ability_in-docs.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.01.00_Configure-ability_In-Docs</a>. This workshop is a focus of this inquiry as it is the point at which I made room for these technical network practices, that were made know-able through smaller working groups on the Servpub project over long periods, to be brought back and made accessible and known to the larger group of In-grid. The scope for this workshop's actions were to do the initial configuring out and setting up of our collective server. This initiation of our network infrastructure made room for In-grid members to build up our technical capacities and emerge future collective and community projects from. The actions of this workshop were contextually quite simple ones, and oriented setting up our first virtual private server (VPS) hosted with Servus and in doing so providing In-grid members with their \"user\" accounts and access to these infrastructures. Along side this technical practice we also figuring out of our own iteration of protocols and intentions for this platform as we came into contact with it and made sense of these frictions. This simplicity of the workshop also aimed to make room to welcomed the wider group of In-grid members to this server space, and through this bring these network practices in-touch with In-grids background. Playfully I named this workshop (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ as we were not only setting up In-grid with a server, but we were also configuring out together what In-grid would serve there. This followed on from this researches methodology, where we made room to collectively inquiry into how we wanted to imagine, tell tales of, and configure out In-grids in-frastructure together.Fortunately I had managed to get a bit of funding from the University for these workshops, which enabled me to go up to London and do the event in person with In-grid members. Even though this was the case a number of In-grid members were running an exhibition in east London at the time, and so Yewen Jin who had volunteered to look after the exhibition asked if we could make it a hybrid event, so we pivoted onto a video call. In this workshop funding I had also factored in refreshments into this budget which meant we could eat and commune together before/during/after the workshop. This was important to bring these social, caring and joyous elements into our in-frastructure. For the access needs form I also made room within its inflexible limits to be oriented through pleasure by not only providing inputs for people's access needs and dietaries, but also for communal joy and indeterminate. I did this by asking what people's favourite snacks and treats were as well as for them to suggest music for the workshop playlist within this access form.Sunni Liao had kindly volunteered their flat for us to meet and do this workshop in. That morning before the workshop me and Sunni had met up and gone climbing like we do together when I am in London. We caught up about life whilst we warmed up and fell off the wall many times. We rushed back to their flat to get ready for the workshop, and prep everything. Sunni cooked up some tasty food for us, while I got the treats and workshop ready. Other Members of In-grid started to arrive and we caught up and got ready together. Running slightly behind we ate as we began the workshop.With Yewen online and the rest of us settling in we started to go through the workshop and practised our protocols as we configured out our server for the first time. Most members of In-grid, especially the ones who were present, are fairly computer and coding literate, with some having existing knowledge of server practices. This meant for the workshop, I could put more focus on querying and feeling out the protocols we were actioning, In this we made room within them to be disoriented by our sense making of relations and feeling of friction from our embodied expertise. To do this I made wiggle room within slides I edited down from the Servpub docs I discussed earlier, making room for us to reflect within each step of this processes, and orient from these points of contact. In each of these creating a sub inquiries into how In-grid would collectively figure out each of these protocols locally. These spaces of reflection are named in context of their actions and were made up of Coding protocols, SSH protocols, Sudo protocols, User protocols, Digital safe space protocols, Collective working protocols. <br>After this collective figuring out of network protocols I asked us to write In-grid's first collective server manifesto together. To do this I made room for us to reflect on the feminist server manifesto (Constant, 2015) and form our own alignments and orientations to/from it. From here we itterated into our own manifesto as a way to coalese these knowledges from this practising of protocols and its collective sense-making into the background of our manifesto. Here manifesting a server as we manifested its manifesto. The resulting Femfester manifesto with a small intro was then published in first edition of Artists Running Datacentres (Simms et al., 2024). Below I reflect on this collective inquiry and the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">notes</a> from the (¬¬)/' Serv(er)ing In-grid_ workshop to give insight into what we came into contact with, disoriented with our embodied expertise and made friction with when configured this collective network infrastructure out together otherwise.<br>06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops<img src=\"08_practice/03_in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/serving_in-grid.png\" draggable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">Serving_In-grid.png<br>In reflecting on our <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a>, our development of accessible doc practices, to make room for Serv(er)ing In-grid by Practicing Protocols to Femfester together our first server manifesto in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.00_configure-ability_in-.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-</a> section, I aimed to offer up how configure-able methods can make room within relations for the flexibility our collective and communal bodies need and orient towards within our sociotechnical infrastructures. This entangle set of inquiries made room for In-grid (and I) to take configure-able methods up and to not only practice but also process and configure out locally the manifestation of our collective infrastructures. Reflecting more closely on the outcomes of the multitude of outcomes, I think it worked well as a method to wiggle room within these technical practices through critical access informed disobedient collective interventions of expertise. In-grid here taking our sweet time to form collective imaginaries from our background and through these direct actions. With these actions making room for our embodied situated knowledges as a group to disorient how we want to configure these social and technical reltions of network infrastructure and collective organising from their sites of impact. For me these inquiries into in-configure-ability, it has emerged as a methodology and practice for In-grid to challenge the norms and sedimented relations of security politics we have inherited through our own disobedient politics and figures of collective access. To do this we retreated from these norms and turned to social practices of forming community trust, interdependence and care. With this movement we aimed to retreat from the myths and figures of security and transparency, to instead orient to that of critical access as a way to distribute the knowing and expertise throughout a group, instead of having it transparently figured out for them.06.04.00_In-reflection07_A Cozier

These take up this reseaches framing of crazed crip manifestos, to act as different manifestations of crip politics and practices embedded within network infrastructures through an interdependent troubling of the ableist and frictions norms.

I finish this chapter by orienting to the future, of desires for more crazed crip infrastructural manifesting, ones that break the clock and disorient the sedimented axis of roles and expertise within these systems.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"A Cozier Configure-Able Methods","level":1,"id":"A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods_0"}],"links":[".html","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.00_en-crip-ing_cozy_time.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.00_intro.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612938,"modifiedTime":1756048612938,"sourceSize":2175,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.00_Intro.md","exportPath":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.00_intro.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html":{"title":"07.01_Background","icon":"","description":"The background of the cozy-cloud orients it between a few places and relations.

I also share how in practice this orients the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a> to be one where disabled bodies are treated without any capacity for care or affirmation by medical institutions. In the last tic presented here I turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, where I came into contact with radical spaces run by M.E.L.T. and Healing Justice London (HJL) which made abundant room for crip politics, critical access and disabled bodies. There is also of course the work that sets up the methods I work with here, where I collaborated with others to critique configuring methods through critical access and emerge <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>. All of these points provide an orientation of retreat from institutionalised practices that extract from and invalidate crip lives before they begin how? Note , and to instead orient towards embodied interdependent crip abundance and life affirmation.<br>Moving in this orientation there are also more granular and nuanced points that informed me to do this. When working in many my collaborations work as a researcher and developer, I found an absence of crip and disabled politics, practices and dialogue. In some research and work contexts this sort of work was if anything closed down when I tried to share or make wiggle room to action it. If you read most crip studies or intersectional feminism, this is very much expected unfortunately. In the prior chapter's work and through intersectional collaborative research I have made room to trouble these silencing norms within collaborations I have the agency to. When reflecting on these experiences, I found that I had a deep desire to begin to orient exactly from what was missing in these backgrounds, or at least on their margins, and that of life affirmation, critical access and radical crip politics. Of course there are many existing radical disabled networks online, from Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project to those that Sins Invalid's Making Connections and Crip Bits (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;121-123), Kevin Gotkin + friends Remote Access Party<a data-footref=\"a2\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> as well as HJL and Aiyana Goodfellow's In Practice<a data-footref=\"60\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-2-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These spaces are just a few of the more well known names of many that are actioning representation not only for disability to be visible, but more importantly for disabled community to connect, share experiences and form dialogues together around their matters and experiences. These though seemed to feel out of reach for specifically this type of infrastructural practice for a few reasons. One being that most of these spaces are not specifically oriented towards cripping technology, and in many ways to keep their online spaces accessible to their communities, they had to work with big tech platforms such Facebook, Zoom and Google. Much like I share in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration</a>, this is due to most Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS) not having accessible functionality prioritised, but also how the technical configure-ability and expertise of FLOSS is figured as something only a small section of people (super users) can really come into contact with. Things have drastically escalated in recent years around the disabling roles that big tech play within society though, from the ways state institutions are wholesale outsourcing their infrastructures and organisational capacities to these private companies that then hold them out of reach of them (Gürses et al. 2022), to the ways that at the same time these companies are being declared by the UN as being complicit within genocide for using the same organisational digital infrastructures (Albanese 2025). Here deeply embedding and militarising our public infrastructures, whilst taking them out of reach so we do not have the capacity or agency to change these relations. For me this is a point where I desired to make room for this contact to happen, and actioned the Cozy-Cloud as a place to wiggle room for the crip community to move towards the promise of a cripped cloud. This is one where we are not only the experts of our own network and community infrastructures, but in this have the capacity to imagine and practice them through critical access and life affirmation. This crip desire both stemming from that of Ahmed's queer desire that makes room for us between determined paths, roles, figures, and relations, but also that of a radical crip desire that overflows from indeterminate and infinite bodily horizons which disorienting these messy technical relations when they are in touch and make their impact on them.<br>When I started to inquire into disabled coding community spaces I found none really within my reach, which is maybe a sign of my research ability and shyness, but also maybe of how few there are. The only thing I found was one disabled coder asking on a stackoverflow, if there was a space to share disabled coding experiences, as they tried to survive hiding their disability from their employer<a data-footref=\"a3\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-3-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. This as well as my own realisation that I also knew very few other disabled coders, prompted me this desire to try and make room for crips to gather, practice and make our impact on network infrastructures. To do this I wanted to make room with the Cozy-Cloud to build up a community and move towards that which was not yet in reach. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party\" target=\"_self\">https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/\" target=\"_self\">https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-2-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh\" target=\"_self\">https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-3-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Background","level":2,"id":"Background_0"}],"links":[".html",".html",".html",".html",".html",".html","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-2-757176f602702d94_0","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.01_inquiring-into-access-knowled-as-configuration.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fn-3-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-1-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-2-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#fnref-3-757176f602702d94_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612938,"modifiedTime":1756048612938,"sourceSize":6788,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.01_Background.md","exportPath":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html":{"title":"07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions","icon":"","description":"This first manifesting of the server explores its initiation and intentions. This part of the Cozy-Cloud's development is very much set in the background of the residency at the BDFI. For this, I had originally been inspired by Kevin Gotkin's Artists in president speech (2021), and so had desired to manifest radical cozy crip politics with and for network infrastructures. To do this I planned to set up an autonomous (movable) sever for hosting resources/infrastructures by and for a crip community. Here I worked with the VPN (Tinc) setup I had learnt from being in touch with the Servpub project to configured the server so that it could be autonomous and roaming. I did this so that it could move around and be installed as a crip cozy relaxation space at events, making room to manifest accessible embodied crip cloud imaginaries, knowledges and expertise as it goes.Throughout this residency period, and as I have mention in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, it was a lot harder to work within this institution and research group than I anticipated. This led me to retreat from my original plan for this exhibition, and instead of trying to form a disabled community within these inflexible relations, I started to orient to manifesting accessible intentions for the crip infrastructure I was manifesting. In this I was thinking about how to make accessible the background that I was emerging this other figure of a Cozy-Cloud from, and its crip promise of access and affirmation. Here I am thinking with how Loiuse Amoore (2020), which I touch on more in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\"05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, as well as Matt Spencer (2022) ask for other relations and backgrounds for the cloud to be made knowable and Configure-Able through. Here I am moving with this by making room for these crip embodied relations to cozily encounter and make an impact on this server. In doing so making room for them to form local counter figures and imaginaries of a crip cloud, disorient these infrastructures knowledges and expertise through the situated plurality of a cozy crip community.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Cozy intentions","level":2,"id":"Cozy_intentions_0"}],"links":[".html","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612938,"modifiedTime":1756048612938,"sourceSize":2248,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md","exportPath":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html":{"title":"07.02.01_Manifesting_intentions","icon":"","description":"To produce the intentions for the Cozy-Cloud I decided to form a set of accessible stickers and Alt text pairs, that could be shared online, as physical and mobile messaging stickers. The decision for choosing this format was for a few reasons. The first because stickers in messaging apps such as signal are a place that have emerged some amazing community driven sticker packs for different activist practices. This includes some like Nematodes and Counter Clouds<a data-footref=\"r4\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, Energy Give Away<a data-footref=\"r5\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-2-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> and In The Ruins of Big Tech<a data-footref=\"r6\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-3-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, which have used this medium to bring these dialogues and relations into our everyday messaging and have been manifested collectively by TITiPI, Varia, Lauren Berlant, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Ren Britton, Other Weapons, Underground division, Batool Desouky and the list goes on. When you send and share these stickers you also send their background and intentions with them, and in these situated transformations they form other modes of dialogue around community, friendship and action together.<br>The second reason that I took this up is also because I felt an access friction within this messaging stickers and a need to try to add Alt texts to this medium. Alt texts are an accessibility practice where you write texts to accompany images so that those who are not able to view them due to visual impairment or other reasons can still be involved in the dialogue that those images make room for. Through a core crip interpretation of access practices being art forms and creative practices of joy and pleasure, not the tiresome mandate necessities rhetoric would incite, I decided to research how this was already being done within Alt texts. In my research I found Alt texts taken up by the disabled community as creative practices with alt text as poetry<a data-footref=\"r7\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-4-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> by Bojana Coklyat and Finnegan Shannon. Here the share how these forms of access can be beautiful and emotive practices that in themselves make room for a diverse, creative and nuanced dialogues that take the image further than the capacities of its visual representation. From a more critical computing approach and with the A platform report of Hamaca's platform by TITiPI (Snelting et al., 2024), it also points out that within network practices alt texts also make room for those with low data speeds/limits/capacities to also be able to engage in the dialogue that the image represents. In these orientations I understand Alt texts as a crip network practice that open up the many ways that access frictions has made space not only for those with visual impairment, but also those disabled from network intimacies by infrastructural limits, geopolitical disparities and ableist network norms.The stickers I made for this are a mix of 3D rendered shaggy clouds and text, made out to be fluffy and soft, with long hair coming off of them. I also use one found free license images. Some of these say a mixture of statements in the fluffy text like \"Lets get cozy\" and \"The cloud is finite, Coziness is infinite\". They are simple and fun and can slip into other dialogues and conversations whilst still holding their politics within their skeuomorphism. Others are more abstract like a cozy shaggy version of Arpanet, an early US military research network. The Alt texts that I wrote for them are made up of two to three sentences, each poetically setting scenes and forming figures and relations to imagine these intentions in action. These sticker and alt texts configuring out room form me to question how I wanted to orient away from the norms of militarised digital network infrastructures, to instead joyously retreat towards crip constellations of care. Each pair forming nonlinear promises of these intentions of crip access, affirmation and justice within network infrastructures.<br>When making these in 3D software I reflected on the other sticker packs that had come before, especially those that emerged around the work of Volumetric Regimes (Rocha and Snelting 2022) which questioned the norms of 3D practices and imaginaries. The We have always been geohackers (Pritchard et al. 2021) essay, which I work with closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</a>, is a part of this book and shows the ways 3D space normalises extractive centralised perspective approaches. With these complexities weighing on me I turned to approaches of Cripping CGI (Decker, 2023; Saucedo &amp; Decker, 2023) where bringing crip bodies and imaginaries in touch with 3D spaces and environments forms frictions around what bodies these technologies have imagined and made room for. Informed by this I began to make room for myself to work with 3D environments and practices to form alternative crip imaginaries and intentions for what this crip network infrastructures is oriented towards and what bodies/relations it wants to make room for. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack\\_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack\\_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-2-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack\\_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-3-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-4-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Manifesting intentions","level":3,"id":"Manifesting_intentions_0"}],"links":["07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-2-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-3-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fn-4-757176f602702d94_0",".html","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-1-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-2-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-3-757176f602702d94_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html#fnref-4-757176f602702d94_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048612939,"modifiedTime":1756048612939,"sourceSize":5463,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.02.01_Manifesting_intentions.md","exportPath":"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.01_manifesting_intentions.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.02_installing_intentions.html":{"title":"07.02.02_Installing_Intentions","icon":"","description":"To share these stickers on the server, I used a light weight content managment system (CMS) called Pico to serve them with.

With this we were thinking with Mia Mingus' (Mingus, 2017) access intimacy as a way to orient how these relations take time and need room to be become knownable, they cannot just be un-encrypted by anyone just like that. With this in focus Mariana came out with the first draft of a shell script that could represent this relation algorithmically, going through a text doc holding a poem of crip times we wrote and encrypting it line by line with our intentions as keys and a preformative en-crip-ing of these poetic crip times. From here we turned to another play on the technical language of computer systems and their maintenance protocols. Here we reconfigured the cron job, a way of calling routine maintenance scripts on unix systems, as a chronic jobs, an indeterminate intimate practice of maintenance and care. Through this intervention we questioned the materiality of these norms of standardised unix time and started to imagine in two places how we could en-crip these computed times. On approach was of how we can hack the existing standardised and pre-figured clock to wiggle room for a crip computational infrastructures now! The other approach questioning the limits of this computational clock, thinking through what it can imagine and make time for, but also how this infinite imaginary of computed time has limits, and ones we imagined crip futures not only within, but also beyond.To en-crip the Unix clock here and now, we hacked these chronic cron jobs to be very disobedient and do things which they were never imagined to do by their deterministic norms. Cron jobs are \"always deterministically on time and up to date\"(Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025 ) but we hacked their code to make room for them to be \"somehow both late, early and on time\"(ibid.). We did this through the cron job code quoted from our essay below, working with computational poetics to form wiggle room in the variability of what these maintenance protocols do, and the bodies, times and horizons they are imagined to hold. From these frictions we felt within these maintenance protocols we disoriented them through our crip expertise. From these points of impact we cripped what these network infrastructures have capacity for when we interdependently care for their limits and constraints.\n\"So, when our chronic job declares\n* * * * * sleep $[RANDOM%69]m ; /home/cozy/chronic/job.sh\nit's saying:\n* = All the time and indefinite\nsleep = Rest as a valid (in)activity\nRANDOM = Indeterminacy\n69 = Interdependence, desire and pleasure\n/home/cozy/chronic/job.sh = Chronic care\" (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025)\nThrough crip en-coding an indefinite indeterminate intimate and restful hack of a chronic cron job to the computational clock of the Cozy-Cloud we poetically cripped its chrononormative<a data-footref=\"610\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> relations here and now. This low level crip infrastructuring being the first on the Cozy-Cloud server, and in many ways crips the background for what can be made here.This cripping of computational intimacies is also en-coded through the \"cozy/chronic/job.sh\" script which is a modified version of the original shell script Mariana proposed. It still went through the poem of crip times, en-crip-ing and de-crip-ing it line by line, but to chronic this job we made it indeterminate, indefinite and non-linear. To do this we programmed it to chose a random line to en-crip or de-crip, indeterminate, which made room for it to go on forever, indefinite, and making a relationship where you have to come back repeatedly with care to get to know it, intimate. Here orienting this poetic crip infrastructure to en-cripped these network norms and bring readers in contact with radical practices and relations of crip time and care.<br>Towards the end of the essay Mariana and I oriented to reflect on the second cripping of the unix clock, and caring beyond its limits.

Here though we also recognised this as a barrier to access the work as it needed somewhat \"expert knowledge\" to do. Here when caring for this site of friction we deciding to reorient it from being in a terminal to being a html page that could be accessed online. In this move the work did retreat from the terminal (a bit), but also in doing so put it in contact the back end of this infrastructure and exchange online for people to connect to directly. Here instead of en-crip-ing a simple text file we moved directly to en-cip-ing a HTML file served up on the Cozy-Cloud. This move also crips the animated relations of normative web stack. HTML, which is a high level languages is normally isolated to work with other high level languages like css and js. In this work we disoriented this by configuring it to make edits to this page directly from Cozy-Cloud's low level chronicly Cripped times. In this motion crossing scales of infrastructures and making accessible and knowable the computational labour and matters that are hidden from this table.As the en-crip-ing scrip we had written, and many chronic illnesses, are both very indiscriminate this also made room to reflect on these cripping actions of infrastructures elsewhere. In particular, much of the formatting of HTML is hidden, but this chronic job did not have the capacity to care, and so en-cripped the &lt;head&gt;, the &lt;body&gt; and everything else in the file.

I can say though that as this cozier looking cloud comes into reach on my horizon, it is starting to feel a lil more snug. These projects have oriented the initial configure-able actions of the Cozy-Cloud, that of making wiggle room within network infrastructures norm for life affirming crip network infrastructures to emerge actions of critical access. In this orientation I have shares how collaborators and I have tried to crip network infrastructuring practices through the embodied frictions we felt when being in contact with them. This has been by both cripping the social and technical relations of these network infrastructures through inquiring into how the sediment limits and contours of these practices made room for our bodily horizons in practice, or not. From these points of impact and friction we made room for us to develop conceptual and critical infrastructures that disorient this misfitting background's figures, relations, politics and times right now. This inquiry into a configure-able Cozy-Cloud has, as I have shared in this chapter, manifested a few outcomes. Firstly a Crip feeling and figuring out as method, here orienting retreating from institutional norms, but in doing so questioning how and caring for what radical imaginaries we bring into contact with these institutions when we do. Here with the retreat as crip manifestation, acknowledging that we can never really escape these institutions, even when you leave like Ahmed(2016). In this retreat though, like Ahmed, we thought about what we surfaced, how we de-sediment these lines and brought Crip/marginalized issues onto the bodily horizon of both computing and academia. More importantly though is also that we gained agency over on our own bodily horizons, getting to become intimate and well within reach of our infrastructures. With this aiming to de-center the expertise within roles to gain flexibility within our actions, intentions, and futures.Now orienting into the present and these futures, the Cozy-Cloud is slowly building up a community of members at a gentle pace. In this orientation we are now focused on how to make it accessible to a wider disability community as well as working out protocols to work together. Technically this has been enacted by re-doing the website to make it a little less technically fritcious, more accessible and multi-user friendly, by moving it to Bludit CMS<a data-footref=\"641\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.04_futures_x_desires.html#fn-1-757176f602702d94_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This has a combination of flexibility for users, as well as good documentation, and being relatively lightweight/low energy both for the server and receiver. To build this up I also designed a custom theme for it called <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy_Night+Day/Cozy_Night+Day.md\" href=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy_night+day/cozy_night+day.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cozy_Night+Day</a>, that not only very light weight and has a cozy light and dark mode, but more importantly is encoded to automatically pick up text with an easy reader to make it even more accessible. We have also opened up for collaborations on the server through a form for crip community to host websites, infrastructures and services for free on the server. From a social side this for me has been a lot of slowing down, having patience and not feeling my \"normative\" webdev and super user urges to manage situations and prescribe problems, and instead orient to making wiggle room for one another to be experts, and reassuring each other that this is fine to take our sweet crip ass time to gently move towards these futures of life affirming accessible network infrastructures.As we build up towards the future together slowly, asynchronously, all over the place but also together right now, I am very content to keep orienting towards crip coziness. Here making room to work independently through the frictions we feel when being together within these technologies.

Here though we also recognised this as a barrier to access the work as it needed somewhat \"expert knowledge\" to do. Here when caring for this site of friction we deciding to reorient it from being in a terminal to being a html page that could be accessed online. In this move the work did retreat from the terminal (a bit), but also in doing so put it in contact the back end of this infrastructure and exchange online for people to connect to directly. Here instead of en-crip-ing a simple text file we moved directly to en-cip-ing a HTML file served up on the Cozy-Cloud. This move also crips the animated relations of normative web stack. HTML, which is a high level languages is normally isolated to work with other high level languages like css and js. In this work we disoriented this by configuring it to make edits to this page directly from Cozy-Cloud's low level chronicly Cripped times. In this motion crossing scales of infrastructures and making accessible and knowable the computational labour and matters that are hidden from this table.As the en-crip-ing scrip we had written, and many chronic illnesses, are both very indiscriminate this also made room to reflect on these cripping actions of infrastructures elsewhere. In particular, much of the formatting of HTML is hidden, but this chronic job did not have the capacity to care, and so en-cripped the &lt;head&gt;, the &lt;body&gt; and everything else in the file.

With these references offering how these two legacies, politics and practices of crip theory and feminist net art have already (always) overlapped, and how people have disoriented and made room for these infrastructures to be configure-able in relation to their situated embodied knowledges and expertise.07.03.02_En-Crip-ing_HeadBodyMariana and I started out talking playfully about encrypting and cripping being similar, both in sounds of the words, but more importantly here, by the way it can represent the intimacy needed for people to get to know each others nuanced access needs. With this we were thinking with Mia Mingus' (Mingus, 2017) access intimacy as a way to orient how these relations take time and need room to be become knownable, they cannot just be un-encrypted by anyone just like that. With this in focus Mariana came out with the first draft of a shell script that could represent this relation algorithmically, going through a text doc holding a poem of crip times we wrote and encrypting it line by line with our intentions as keys and a preformative en-crip-ing of these poetic crip times. From here we turned to another play on the technical language of computer systems and their maintenance protocols. Here we reconfigured the cron job, a way of calling routine maintenance scripts on unix systems, as a chronic jobs, an indeterminate intimate practice of maintenance and care. Through this intervention we questioned the materiality of these norms of standardised unix time and started to imagine in two places how we could en-crip these computed times. On approach was of how we can hack the existing standardised and pre-figured clock to wiggle room for a crip computational infrastructures now! The other approach questioning the limits of this computational clock, thinking through what it can imagine and make time for, but also how this infinite imaginary of computed time has limits, and ones we imagined crip futures not only within, but also beyond.To en-crip the Unix clock here and now, we hacked these chronic cron jobs to be very disobedient and do things which they were never imagined to do by their deterministic norms. Cron jobs are \"always deterministically on time and up to date\"(Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025 ) but we hacked their code to make room for them to be \"somehow both late, early and on time\"(ibid.). We did this through the cron job code quoted from our essay below, working with computational poetics to form wiggle room in the variability of what these maintenance protocols do, and the bodies, times and horizons they are imagined to hold. From these frictions we felt within these maintenance protocols we disoriented them through our crip expertise. From these points of impact we cripped what these network infrastructures have capacity for when we interdependently care for their limits and constraints.\n\"So, when our chronic job declares\n* * * * * sleep $[RANDOM%69]m ; /home/cozy/chronic/job.sh\nit's saying:\n* = All the time and indefinite\nsleep = Rest as a valid (in)activity\nRANDOM = Indeterminacy\n69 = Interdependence, desire and pleasure\n/home/cozy/chronic/job.sh = Chronic care\" (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025)\nThrough crip en-coding an indefinite indeterminate intimate and restful hack of a chronic cron job to the computational clock of the Cozy-Cloud we poetically cripped its chrononormative<a data-footref=\"610\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-c69615898a761ffd_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> relations here and now. This low level crip infrastructuring being the first on the Cozy-Cloud server, and in many ways crips the background for what can be made here.This cripping of computational intimacies is also en-coded through the \"cozy/chronic/job.sh\" script which is a modified version of the original shell script Mariana proposed. It still went through the poem of crip times, en-crip-ing and de-crip-ing it line by line, but to chronic this job we made it indeterminate, indefinite and non-linear. To do this we programmed it to chose a random line to en-crip or de-crip, indeterminate, which made room for it to go on forever, indefinite, and making a relationship where you have to come back repeatedly with care to get to know it, intimate. Here orienting this poetic crip infrastructure to en-cripped these network norms and bring readers in contact with radical practices and relations of crip time and care.<br>Towards the end of the essay Mariana and I oriented to reflect on the second cripping of the unix clock, and caring beyond its limits. This was as Mariana raised, this clock is nearing its determined bit limit and end of unix time in 2036.

This collaboration was with Mariana Marongoni<a data-footref=\"r8\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-dcaa52321d30494b_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> who is a Brazilian transdisciplinary artist, web developer, and researcher based in London. In her work she critically explores media materiality and the aesthetics of decay through installations, web-based experiments, and visual poetry. This collaboration emerged through many bumping intos of each other through our PhD research, going to events, conferences and workshops. In these spaces we were crip buddies, chatting, helping each other out, complaining about how tired/fatigued we were. From these mainy encounter with a lack of access we emerged a desire/need to try cripping these relations we were impacted by a little. From this we started to come together to figure out how we could interdependently crip the Cozy-Cloud server and the ableist norms of computing through our own embodies expertise and knowledges. These initial conversations from us turned into the work/infrastructure En-crip-ing time which was presented at Mesh festival in Basel<a data-footref=\"r9\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-dcaa52321d30494b_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and accompanied by a published essay En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&amp;with a SexCI Chronic Job (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025). <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.marianamarangoni.com\" target=\"_self\">https://www.marianamarangoni.com</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-dcaa52321d30494b_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://2024.meshfestival.ch/events/george-simms-mariana-marangoni-chronic-qts/de.html\" target=\"_self\">https://2024.meshfestival.ch/events/george-simms-mariana-marangoni-chronic-qts/de.html</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-2-dcaa52321d30494b_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n07.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time<br>The background of the cozy-cloud orients it between a few places and relations.

In another tic there is also the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> that demonstrates the way the norms of institutionalised computational practices often invalidate or disappear crip lives and critical dialogues of access from their tables. I also share how in practice this orients the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a> to be one where disabled bodies are treated without any capacity for care or affirmation by medical institutions. In the last tic presented here I turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, where I came into contact with radical spaces run by M.E.L.T. and Healing Justice London (HJL) which made abundant room for crip politics, critical access and disabled bodies. There is also of course the work that sets up the methods I work with here, where I collaborated with others to critique configuring methods through critical access and emerge <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>. All of these points provide an orientation of retreat from institutionalised practices that extract from and invalidate crip lives before they begin how? Note , and to instead orient towards embodied interdependent crip abundance and life affirmation.<br>Moving in this orientation there are also more granular and nuanced points that informed me to do this. When working in many my collaborations work as a researcher and developer, I found an absence of crip and disabled politics, practices and dialogue. In some research and work contexts this sort of work was if anything closed down when I tried to share or make wiggle room to action it. If you read most crip studies or intersectional feminism, this is very much expected unfortunately. In the prior chapter's work and through intersectional collaborative research I have made room to trouble these silencing norms within collaborations I have the agency to. When reflecting on these experiences, I found that I had a deep desire to begin to orient exactly from what was missing in these backgrounds, or at least on their margins, and that of life affirmation, critical access and radical crip politics. Of course there are many existing radical disabled networks online, from Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project to those that Sins Invalid's Making Connections and Crip Bits (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;121-123), Kevin Gotkin + friends Remote Access Party<a data-footref=\"a2\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> as well as HJL and Aiyana Goodfellow's In Practice<a data-footref=\"60\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These spaces are just a few of the more well known names of many that are actioning representation not only for disability to be visible, but more importantly for disabled community to connect, share experiences and form dialogues together around their matters and experiences. These though seemed to feel out of reach for specifically this type of infrastructural practice for a few reasons. One being that most of these spaces are not specifically oriented towards cripping technology, and in many ways to keep their online spaces accessible to their communities, they had to work with big tech platforms such Facebook, Zoom and Google. Much like I share in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration</a>, this is due to most Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS) not having accessible functionality prioritised, but also how the technical configure-ability and expertise of FLOSS is figured as something only a small section of people (super users) can really come into contact with. Things have drastically escalated in recent years around the disabling roles that big tech play within society though, from the ways state institutions are wholesale outsourcing their infrastructures and organisational capacities to these private companies that then hold them out of reach of them (Gürses et al. 2022), to the ways that at the same time these companies are being declared by the UN as being complicit within genocide for using the same organisational digital infrastructures (Albanese 2025). Here deeply embedding and militarising our public infrastructures, whilst taking them out of reach so we do not have the capacity or agency to change these relations. For me this is a point where I desired to make room for this contact to happen, and actioned the Cozy-Cloud as a place to wiggle room for the crip community to move towards the promise of a cripped cloud. This is one where we are not only the experts of our own network and community infrastructures, but in this have the capacity to imagine and practice them through critical access and life affirmation. This crip desire both stemming from that of Ahmed's queer desire that makes room for us between determined paths, roles, figures, and relations, but also that of a radical crip desire that overflows from indeterminate and infinite bodily horizons which disorienting these messy technical relations when they are in touch and make their impact on them.<br>When I started to inquire into disabled coding community spaces I found none really within my reach, which is maybe a sign of my research ability and shyness, but also maybe of how few there are. The only thing I found was one disabled coder asking on a stackoverflow, if there was a space to share disabled coding experiences, as they tried to survive hiding their disability from their employer<a data-footref=\"a3\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. This as well as my own realisation that I also knew very few other disabled coders, prompted me this desire to try and make room for crips to gather, practice and make our impact on network infrastructures. To do this I wanted to make room with the Cozy-Cloud to build up a community and move towards that which was not yet in reach. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party\" target=\"_self\">https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/\" target=\"_self\">https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-2-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh\" target=\"_self\">https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-3-08c25a729bc72fcf_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n07.01_Background<br>This section reflects back to <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs</a>, and the way In-grid and I made wiggled room with sedimented formats, roles and centralisation of technical expertise. Working with Kelsie Acton's Semi-Plain language (2023), In-grid and I did this so that these docs were not only accessible from different approaches and capacities, but to also distribute the expertise of these social and technical infrastructures. In the accompanying essay to the En-crip-ing time infrastructure/artwork, called En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&amp;with a SexCI Chronic Job (2025), Mariana and I inquired into how we could similarly approach the sedimented formats of academic essays and practice to wiggle room into their sedimented code, practices and capacity to manifest this crip infrastructure. Doing this we disoriented these technologies as a way to crip these individualises relations of practice and theory, plan and action, paper and code, to not divided them but make room to coalesce them together at one table. This was in a very playful, poetic and joyful expression of how these two complex institutionally configured formats of technical docs and academic texts can meet. Here figuring out what impression these two discipline make upon one another when in touch. In this contact we manifested room for these bodies to form questions around what kinds of variability they need both to be in touch.07.03.04_En-crip-ing_academic_docsIt is hard to say a lot in reflection when the Cozy-Cloud still has so much going on in the present and planned for the future. I can say though that as this cozier looking cloud comes into reach on my horizon, it is starting to feel a lil more snug. These projects have oriented the initial configure-able actions of the Cozy-Cloud, that of making wiggle room within network infrastructures norm for life affirming crip network infrastructures to emerge actions of critical access. In this orientation I have shares how collaborators and I have tried to crip network infrastructuring practices through the embodied frictions we felt when being in contact with them. This has been by both cripping the social and technical relations of these network infrastructures through inquiring into how the sediment limits and contours of these practices made room for our bodily horizons in practice, or not. From these points of impact and friction we made room for us to develop conceptual and critical infrastructures that disorient this misfitting background's figures, relations, politics and times right now. This inquiry into a configure-able Cozy-Cloud has, as I have shared in this chapter, manifested a few outcomes. Firstly a Crip feeling and figuring out as method, here orienting retreating from institutional norms, but in doing so questioning how and caring for what radical imaginaries we bring into contact with these institutions when we do. Here with the retreat as crip manifestation, acknowledging that we can never really escape these institutions, even when you leave like Ahmed(2016). In this retreat though, like Ahmed, we thought about what we surfaced, how we de-sediment these lines and brought Crip/marginalized issues onto the bodily horizon of both computing and academia. More importantly though is also that we gained agency over on our own bodily horizons, getting to become intimate and well within reach of our infrastructures. With this aiming to de-center the expertise within roles to gain flexibility within our actions, intentions, and futures.<br>Now orienting into the present and these futures, the Cozy-Cloud is slowly building up a community of members at a gentle pace. In this orientation we are now focused on how to make it accessible to a wider disability community as well as working out protocols to work together. Technically this has been enacted by re-doing the website to make it a little less technically fritcious, more accessible and multi-user friendly, by moving it to Bludit CMS<a data-footref=\"641\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-caaa9d672bef7cf9_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This has a combination of flexibility for users, as well as good documentation, and being relatively lightweight/low energy both for the server and receiver. To build this up I also designed a custom theme for it called <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy_Night+Day/Cozy_Night+Day.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cozy_Night+Day</a>, that not only very light weight and has a cozy light and dark mode, but more importantly is encoded to automatically pick up text with an easy reader to make it even more accessible. We have also opened up for collaborations on the server through a form for crip community to host websites, infrastructures and services for free on the server. From a social side this for me has been a lot of slowing down, having patience and not feeling my \"normative\" webdev and super user urges to manage situations and prescribe problems, and instead orient to making wiggle room for one another to be experts, and reassuring each other that this is fine to take our sweet crip ass time to gently move towards these futures of life affirming accessible network infrastructures.As we build up towards the future together slowly, asynchronously, all over the place but also together right now, I am very content to keep orienting towards crip coziness. Here making room to work independently through the frictions we feel when being together within these technologies. Manifesting Coziness not only as a practice to care for the frictions of the day, but also as a promise and a destination at the end of many long days, weeks, years and life-times. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.bludit.com/\" target=\"_self\">https://www.bludit.com/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-caaa9d672bef7cf9_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n07.04_Futures_x_Desires<br>This chapter reflects on my inquiry into the coalescing of the Cozy-Cloud server as a crip and disability justice centred network infrastructure. This Inquiry moves on from the embedded intersectional collaboration with In-grid, which is covered in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a>, to instead orient these digital network infrastructures to be directly in touch with radical crip imaginaries, embodied knowledges, disorienting practices and indeterminate expertise. To do this I reflect on the work of the Cozy-Cloud through two creative outcomes and infrastructures. These take up this reseaches framing of crazed crip manifestos, to act as different manifestations of crip politics and practices embedded within network infrastructures through an interdependent troubling of the ableist and frictions norms. In doing this I aim to share how crip infrastructuring came into being and how these inquiries and their actions made room for my collaborators and I to imagine, figure out and feel the impacts of a cripped bodily horizons on network infrastructures.<br>With these crip network manifestings in focus, I reflect on it in 4 parts, again forming a <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.01_Background.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.01_Background</a> for this chapter and its figures to emerge from. I then focus in on my <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> for this crip server, orienting how I made space within alt texts, sticker packs, cozy pillows and websites to hold the non-linear intentions of the Cozy-Cloud, which oriente it towards life affirming network infrastructures. I follow this by reflecting on the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.00_en-crip-ing_cozy_time.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time</a>, which was a collaboration between Mariana Marongoni and I on the Cozy-Cloud. With the server we manifested chronic cron jobs to poetically crip the servers computational clock and make room for a plurality of times. I finish this chapter by orienting to the future, of desires for more crazed crip infrastructural manifesting, ones that break the clock and disorient the sedimented axis of roles and expertise within these systems.07.00_Intro06_In-Configure-Ability_canvas.canvas09_Conclusion_canvas.canvas<br>To produce the intentions for the Cozy-Cloud I decided to form a set of accessible stickers and Alt text pairs, that could be shared online, as physical and mobile messaging stickers. The decision for choosing this format was for a few reasons. The first because stickers in messaging apps such as signal are a place that have emerged some amazing community driven sticker packs for different activist practices. This includes some like Nematodes and Counter Clouds<a data-footref=\"r4\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-1-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, Energy Give Away<a data-footref=\"r5\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-2-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> and In The Ruins of Big Tech<a data-footref=\"r6\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-3-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, which have used this medium to bring these dialogues and relations into our everyday messaging and have been manifested collectively by TITiPI, Varia, Lauren Berlant, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Ren Britton, Other Weapons, Underground division, Batool Desouky and the list goes on. When you send and share these stickers you also send their background and intentions with them, and in these situated transformations they form other modes of dialogue around community, friendship and action together.<br>The second reason that I took this up is also because I felt an access friction within this messaging stickers and a need to try to add Alt texts to this medium. Alt texts are an accessibility practice where you write texts to accompany images so that those who are not able to view them due to visual impairment or other reasons can still be involved in the dialogue that those images make room for. Through a core crip interpretation of access practices being art forms and creative practices of joy and pleasure, not the tiresome mandate necessities rhetoric would incite, I decided to research how this was already being done within Alt texts. In my research I found Alt texts taken up by the disabled community as creative practices with alt text as poetry<a data-footref=\"r7\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fn-4-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> by Bojana Coklyat and Finnegan Shannon. Here the share how these forms of access can be beautiful and emotive practices that in themselves make room for a diverse, creative and nuanced dialogues that take the image further than the capacities of its visual representation. From a more critical computing approach and with the A platform report of Hamaca's platform by TITiPI (Snelting et al., 2024), it also points out that within network practices alt texts also make room for those with low data speeds/limits/capacities to also be able to engage in the dialogue that the image represents. In these orientations I understand Alt texts as a crip network practice that open up the many ways that access frictions has made space not only for those with visual impairment, but also those disabled from network intimacies by infrastructural limits, geopolitical disparities and ableist network norms.The stickers I made for this are a mix of 3D rendered shaggy clouds and text, made out to be fluffy and soft, with long hair coming off of them. I also use one found free license images. Some of these say a mixture of statements in the fluffy text like \"Lets get cozy\" and \"The cloud is finite, Coziness is infinite\". They are simple and fun and can slip into other dialogues and conversations whilst still holding their politics within their skeuomorphism. Others are more abstract like a cozy shaggy version of Arpanet, an early US military research network. The Alt texts that I wrote for them are made up of two to three sentences, each poetically setting scenes and forming figures and relations to imagine these intentions in action. These sticker and alt texts configuring out room form me to question how I wanted to orient away from the norms of militarised digital network infrastructures, to instead joyously retreat towards crip constellations of care. Each pair forming nonlinear promises of these intentions of crip access, affirmation and justice within network infrastructures.<br>When making these in 3D software I reflected on the other sticker packs that had come before, especially those that emerged around the work of Volumetric Regimes (Rocha and Snelting 2022) which questioned the norms of 3D practices and imaginaries. The We have always been geohackers (Pritchard et al. 2021) essay, which I work with closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</a>, is a part of this book and shows the ways 3D space normalises extractive centralised perspective approaches. With these complexities weighing on me I turned to approaches of Cripping CGI (Decker, 2023; Saucedo &amp; Decker, 2023) where bringing crip bodies and imaginaries in touch with 3D spaces and environments forms frictions around what bodies these technologies have imagined and made room for. Informed by this I began to make room for myself to work with 3D environments and practices to form alternative crip imaginaries and intentions for what this crip network infrastructures is oriented towards and what bodies/relations it wants to make room for. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack\\_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-1-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack\\_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-2-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack\\_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-3-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a-cozier-configure-ability_canvas.html#fnref-4-59ac10cb654559dc_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n07.02.01_Manifesting_intentions<br>To share these stickers on the server, I used a light weight content managment system (CMS) called Pico to serve them with.

For the installed cozy relaxation space I also made a printed easy read version so that people could engage with them in a number of ways and not just through a browser which can be a barrier to access. To accompany the installation I had a set of cozy-cloud pillows made . These were very much real world versions of the clouds in the stickers, with soft shaggy fabric that you can hold and made room for another way to feel out, sense and imagine the intentions of this crip server. These different avenues aimed to offer the multiplicity of a crip server, both online, offline, and in touch with affective embodied ways of relating to it's intentions.<br>Alongside this I also did an early version of accessible docs to try and practice these technologies through critical accessibility. These are now defunct but informed my work with In-grid to make our <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.01.02.01_In-Docs</a>.

This part of the Cozy-Cloud's development is very much set in the background of the residency at the BDFI. For this, I had originally been inspired by Kevin Gotkin's Artists in president speech (2021), and so had desired to manifest radical cozy crip politics with and for network infrastructures. To do this I planned to set up an autonomous (movable) sever for hosting resources/infrastructures by and for a crip community. Here I worked with the VPN (Tinc) setup I had learnt from being in touch with the Servpub project to configured the server so that it could be autonomous and roaming. I did this so that it could move around and be installed as a crip cozy relaxation space at events, making room to manifest accessible embodied crip cloud imaginaries, knowledges and expertise as it goes.<br>Throughout this residency period, and as I have mention in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, it was a lot harder to work within this institution and research group than I anticipated. This led me to retreat from my original plan for this exhibition, and instead of trying to form a disabled community within these inflexible relations, I started to orient to manifesting accessible intentions for the crip infrastructure I was manifesting. In this I was thinking about how to make accessible the background that I was emerging this other figure of a Cozy-Cloud from, and its crip promise of access and affirmation. Here I am thinking with how Loiuse Amoore (2020), which I touch on more in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, as well as Matt Spencer (2022) ask for other relations and backgrounds for the cloud to be made knowable and Configure-Able through. Here I am moving with this by making room for these crip embodied relations to cozily encounter and make an impact on this server. In doing so making room for them to form local counter figures and imaginaries of a crip cloud, disorient these infrastructures knowledges and expertise through the situated plurality of a cozy crip

07_A Cozier Configure-ability_canvas07.00_IntroThis chapter reflects on my inquiry into the coalescing of the Cozy-Cloud server as a crip and disability justice centred network infrastructure. This Inquiry moves on from the embedded intersectional collaboration with In-grid, which is covered in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_In-Configure-Ability</a>, to instead orient these digital network infrastructures to be directly in touch with radical crip imaginaries, embodied knowledges, disorienting practices and indeterminate expertise. To do this I reflect on the work of the Cozy-Cloud through two creative outcomes and infrastructures. These take up this reseaches framing of crazed crip manifestos, to act as different manifestations of crip politics and practices embedded within network infrastructures through an interdependent troubling of the ableist and frictions norms. In doing this I aim to share how crip infrastructuring came into being and how these inquiries and their actions made room for my collaborators and I to imagine, figure out and feel the impacts of a cripped bodily horizons on network infrastructures.<br>With these crip network manifestings in focus, I reflect on it in 4 parts, again forming a <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.01_Background.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.01_background.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.01_Background</a> for this chapter and its figures to emerge from. I then focus in on my <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> for this crip server, orienting how I made space within alt texts, sticker packs, cozy pillows and websites to hold the non-linear intentions of the Cozy-Cloud, which oriente it towards life affirming network infrastructures. I follow this by reflecting on the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"07.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.00_en-crip-ing_cozy_time.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.03.00_En-crip-ing_cozy_time</a>, which was a collaboration between Mariana Marongoni and I on the Cozy-Cloud. With the server we manifested chronic cron jobs to poetically crip the servers computational clock and make room for a plurality of times. I finish this chapter by orienting to the future, of desires for more crazed crip infrastructural manifesting, ones that break the clock and disorient the sedimented axis of roles and expertise within these systems.\n07.01_Background<br>The background of the cozy-cloud orients it between a few places and relations. In the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes</a> that parallels the literature review earlier in this thesis, and where I situate this research within my experience there are three points I will touch on again briefly. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a> I share the Cozy-Cloud's initiation during the residency with the XDFI, and this background of research normalises and fetishizes disabled bodies whilst also infantilising and invalidating them and their knowledges and expertise. In another tic there is also the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.02_The_computing_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.02_The_computing_table</a> that demonstrates the way the norms of institutionalised computational practices often invalidate or disappear crip lives and critical dialogues of access from their tables. I also share how in practice this orients the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.03_The_operating_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.03_The_operating_table</a> to be one where disabled bodies are treated without any capacity for care or affirmation by medical institutions. In the last tic presented here I turn to the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.04_The_crip_table</a>, where I came into contact with radical spaces run by M.E.L.T. and Healing Justice London (HJL) which made abundant room for crip politics, critical access and disabled bodies. There is also of course the work that sets up the methods I work with here, where I collaborated with others to critique configuring methods through critical access and emerge <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/04_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">04_Configure-Able_Methods</a>. All of these points provide an orientation of retreat from institutionalised practices that extract from and invalidate crip lives before they begin how? Note , and to instead orient towards embodied interdependent crip abundance and life affirmation.<br>Moving in this orientation there are also more granular and nuanced points that informed me to do this. When working in many my collaborations work as a researcher and developer, I found an absence of crip and disabled politics, practices and dialogue. In some research and work contexts this sort of work was if anything closed down when I tried to share or make wiggle room to action it. If you read most crip studies or intersectional feminism, this is very much expected unfortunately. In the prior chapter's work and through intersectional collaborative research I have made room to trouble these silencing norms within collaborations I have the agency to. When reflecting on these experiences, I found that I had a deep desire to begin to orient exactly from what was missing in these backgrounds, or at least on their margins, and that of life affirmation, critical access and radical crip politics. Of course there are many existing radical disabled networks online, from Alice Wong's Disability Visibility Project to those that Sins Invalid's Making Connections and Crip Bits (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;121-123), Kevin Gotkin + friends Remote Access Party<a data-footref=\"a2\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> as well as HJL and Aiyana Goodfellow's In Practice<a data-footref=\"60\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. These spaces are just a few of the more well known names of many that are actioning representation not only for disability to be visible, but more importantly for disabled community to connect, share experiences and form dialogues together around their matters and experiences. These though seemed to feel out of reach for specifically this type of infrastructural practice for a few reasons. One being that most of these spaces are not specifically oriented towards cripping technology, and in many ways to keep their online spaces accessible to their communities, they had to work with big tech platforms such Facebook, Zoom and Google. Much like I share in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.01_Inquiring into Access-Knowled as configuration</a>, this is due to most Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS) not having accessible functionality prioritised, but also how the technical configure-ability and expertise of FLOSS is figured as something only a small section of people (super users) can really come into contact with. Things have drastically escalated in recent years around the disabling roles that big tech play within society though, from the ways state institutions are wholesale outsourcing their infrastructures and organisational capacities to these private companies that then hold them out of reach of them (Gürses et al. 2022), to the ways that at the same time these companies are being declared by the UN as being complicit within genocide for using the same organisational digital infrastructures (Albanese 2025). Here deeply embedding and militarising our public infrastructures, whilst taking them out of reach so we do not have the capacity or agency to change these relations. For me this is a point where I desired to make room for this contact to happen, and actioned the Cozy-Cloud as a place to wiggle room for the crip community to move towards the promise of a cripped cloud. This is one where we are not only the experts of our own network and community infrastructures, but in this have the capacity to imagine and practice them through critical access and life affirmation. This crip desire both stemming from that of Ahmed's queer desire that makes room for us between determined paths, roles, figures, and relations, but also that of a radical crip desire that overflows from indeterminate and infinite bodily horizons which disorienting these messy technical relations when they are in touch and make their impact on them.<br>When I started to inquire into disabled coding community spaces I found none really within my reach, which is maybe a sign of my research ability and shyness, but also maybe of how few there are. The only thing I found was one disabled coder asking on a stackoverflow, if there was a space to share disabled coding experiences, as they tried to survive hiding their disability from their employer<a data-footref=\"a3\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-3-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>. This as well as my own realisation that I also knew very few other disabled coders, prompted me this desire to try and make room for crips to gather, practice and make our impact on network infrastructures. To do this I wanted to make room with the Cozy-Cloud to build up a community and move towards that which was not yet in reach. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party\" target=\"_self\">https://www.criticaldesignlab.com/project/remote-access-party</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/\" target=\"_self\">https://healingjusticeldn.org/in-practice-archive/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-2-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh\" target=\"_self\">https://dev.to/ehelaya/coders-with-disability-3jkh</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-3-730e98fc1aafa841_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 07.02.00_Cozy_IntentionsThis first manifesting of the server explores its initiation and intentions. This part of the Cozy-Cloud's development is very much set in the background of the residency at the BDFI. For this, I had originally been inspired by Kevin Gotkin's Artists in president speech (2021), and so had desired to manifest radical cozy crip politics with and for network infrastructures. To do this I planned to set up an autonomous (movable) sever for hosting resources/infrastructures by and for a crip community. Here I worked with the VPN (Tinc) setup I had learnt from being in touch with the Servpub project to configured the server so that it could be autonomous and roaming. I did this so that it could move around and be installed as a crip cozy relaxation space at events, making room to manifest accessible embodied crip cloud imaginaries, knowledges and expertise as it goes.<br>Throughout this residency period, and as I have mention in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../02_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/02_entries/02.01_The_research_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">02.01_The_research_table</a>, it was a lot harder to work within this institution and research group than I anticipated. This led me to retreat from my original plan for this exhibition, and instead of trying to form a disabled community within these inflexible relations, I started to orient to manifesting accessible intentions for the crip infrastructure I was manifesting. In this I was thinking about how to make accessible the background that I was emerging this other figure of a Cozy-Cloud from, and its crip promise of access and affirmation. Here I am thinking with how Loiuse Amoore (2020), which I touch on more in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a>, as well as Matt Spencer (2022) ask for other relations and backgrounds for the cloud to be made knowable and Configure-Able through. Here I am moving with this by making room for these crip embodied relations to cozily encounter and make an impact on this server. In doing so making room for them to form local counter figures and imaginaries of a crip cloud, disorient these infrastructures knowledges and expertise through the situated plurality of a cozy crip community.\n07.02.01_Manifesting_intentions<br>To produce the intentions for the Cozy-Cloud I decided to form a set of accessible stickers and Alt text pairs, that could be shared online, as physical and mobile messaging stickers. The decision for choosing this format was for a few reasons. The first because stickers in messaging apps such as signal are a place that have emerged some amazing community driven sticker packs for different activist practices. This includes some like Nematodes and Counter Clouds<a data-footref=\"r4\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, Energy Give Away<a data-footref=\"r5\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> and In The Ruins of Big Tech<a data-footref=\"r6\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-3-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, which have used this medium to bring these dialogues and relations into our everyday messaging and have been manifested collectively by TITiPI, Varia, Lauren Berlant, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Ren Britton, Other Weapons, Underground division, Batool Desouky and the list goes on. When you send and share these stickers you also send their background and intentions with them, and in these situated transformations they form other modes of dialogue around community, friendship and action together.<br>The second reason that I took this up is also because I felt an access friction within this messaging stickers and a need to try to add Alt texts to this medium. Alt texts are an accessibility practice where you write texts to accompany images so that those who are not able to view them due to visual impairment or other reasons can still be involved in the dialogue that those images make room for. Through a core crip interpretation of access practices being art forms and creative practices of joy and pleasure, not the tiresome mandate necessities rhetoric would incite, I decided to research how this was already being done within Alt texts. In my research I found Alt texts taken up by the disabled community as creative practices with alt text as poetry<a data-footref=\"r7\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-4-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a> by Bojana Coklyat and Finnegan Shannon. Here the share how these forms of access can be beautiful and emotive practices that in themselves make room for a diverse, creative and nuanced dialogues that take the image further than the capacities of its visual representation. From a more critical computing approach and with the A platform report of Hamaca's platform by TITiPI (Snelting et al., 2024), it also points out that within network practices alt texts also make room for those with low data speeds/limits/capacities to also be able to engage in the dialogue that the image represents. In these orientations I understand Alt texts as a crip network practice that open up the many ways that access frictions has made space not only for those with visual impairment, but also those disabled from network intimacies by infrastructural limits, geopolitical disparities and ableist network norms.The stickers I made for this are a mix of 3D rendered shaggy clouds and text, made out to be fluffy and soft, with long hair coming off of them. I also use one found free license images. Some of these say a mixture of statements in the fluffy text like \"Lets get cozy\" and \"The cloud is finite, Coziness is infinite\". They are simple and fun and can slip into other dialogues and conversations whilst still holding their politics within their skeuomorphism. Others are more abstract like a cozy shaggy version of Arpanet, an early US military research network. The Alt texts that I wrote for them are made up of two to three sentences, each poetically setting scenes and forming figures and relations to imagine these intentions in action. These sticker and alt texts configuring out room form me to question how I wanted to orient away from the norms of militarised digital network infrastructures, to instead joyously retreat towards crip constellations of care. Each pair forming nonlinear promises of these intentions of crip access, affirmation and justice within network infrastructures.<br>When making these in 3D software I reflected on the other sticker packs that had come before, especially those that emerged around the work of Volumetric Regimes (Rocha and Snelting 2022) which questioned the norms of 3D practices and imaginaries. The We have always been geohackers (Pritchard et al. 2021) essay, which I work with closely in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../04_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles/03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">03_Disobedient_Action_Research_Cycles</a>, is a part of this book and shows the ways 3D space normalises extractive centralised perspective approaches. With these complexities weighing on me I turned to approaches of Cripping CGI (Decker, 2023; Saucedo &amp; Decker, 2023) where bringing crip bodies and imaginaries in touch with 3D spaces and environments forms frictions around what bodies these technologies have imagined and made room for. Informed by this I began to make room for myself to work with 3D environments and practices to form alternative crip imaginaries and intentions for what this crip network infrastructures is oriented towards and what bodies/relations it wants to make room for. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack%5C_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=1f930e15864f32d21ff3d4daeb5c34b8&amp;pack\\_key=7d3aed79d95f135c70350190b3911151ac782db547eafba6bf0d67f92b63ea3a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack%5C_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=f998894a4595a1b4791a648f24e1e16d&amp;pack\\_key=6953c272698ffce39d7a32c0bbf2d040a46dfb3a66c800873d2d6ed649ba372d</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-2-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://signal.art/addstickers/%5C#pack%5C_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack%5C_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a\" target=\"_self\">https://signal.art/addstickers/\\#pack\\_id=6e69c3260e3c7378c0f35b86342e6f72&amp;pack\\_key=f6940570bf17201e7288874ced7e32098df100705dc7862af3c2c026b32a8f9a</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-3-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/\" target=\"_self\">https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-4-d93725e73847f6a5_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 07.02.02_Installing_Intentions<br>To share these stickers on the server, I used a light weight content managment system (CMS) called Pico to serve them with.

For the installed cozy relaxation space I also made a printed easy read version so that people could engage with them in a number of ways and not just through a browser which can be a barrier to access. To accompany the installation I had a set of cozy-cloud pillows made . These were very much real world versions of the clouds in the stickers, with soft shaggy fabric that you can hold and made room for another way to feel out, sense and imagine the intentions of this crip server. These different avenues aimed to offer the multiplicity of a crip server, both online, offline, and in touch with affective embodied ways of relating to it's intentions.<br>Alongside this I also did an early version of accessible docs to try and practice these technologies through critical accessibility.

This collaboration was with Mariana Marongoni<a data-footref=\"r8\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-0a13ccfa1e23c99d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> who is a Brazilian transdisciplinary artist, web developer, and researcher based in London. In her work she critically explores media materiality and the aesthetics of decay through installations, web-based experiments, and visual poetry. This collaboration emerged through many bumping intos of each other through our PhD research, going to events, conferences and workshops. In these spaces we were crip buddies, chatting, helping each other out, complaining about how tired/fatigued we were. From these mainy encounter with a lack of access we emerged a desire/need to try cripping these relations we were impacted by a little. From this we started to come together to figure out how we could interdependently crip the Cozy-Cloud server and the ableist norms of computing through our own embodies expertise and knowledges. These initial conversations from us turned into the work/infrastructure En-crip-ing time which was presented at Mesh festival in Basel<a data-footref=\"r9\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-0a13ccfa1e23c99d_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and accompanied by a published essay En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&amp;with a SexCI Chronic Job (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025). <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.marianamarangoni.com\" target=\"_self\">https://www.marianamarangoni.com</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-0a13ccfa1e23c99d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://2024.meshfestival.ch/events/george-simms-mariana-marangoni-chronic-qts/de.html\" target=\"_self\">https://2024.meshfestival.ch/events/george-simms-mariana-marangoni-chronic-qts/de.html</a><a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-2-0a13ccfa1e23c99d_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a> 07.03.01_en-crip-ing_timeMariana and I started out talking playfully about encrypting and cripping being similar, both in sounds of the words, but more importantly here, by the way it can represent the intimacy needed for people to get to know each others nuanced access needs. With this we were thinking with Mia Mingus' (Mingus, 2017) access intimacy as a way to orient how these relations take time and need room to be become knownable, they cannot just be un-encrypted by anyone just like that. With this in focus Mariana came out with the first draft of a shell script that could represent this relation algorithmically, going through a text doc holding a poem of crip times we wrote and encrypting it line by line with our intentions as keys and a preformative en-crip-ing of these poetic crip times. From here we turned to another play on the technical language of computer systems and their maintenance protocols. Here we reconfigured the cron job, a way of calling routine maintenance scripts on unix systems, as a chronic jobs, an indeterminate intimate practice of maintenance and care. Through this intervention we questioned the materiality of these norms of standardised unix time and started to imagine in two places how we could en-crip these computed times. On approach was of how we can hack the existing standardised and pre-figured clock to wiggle room for a crip computational infrastructures now! The other approach questioning the limits of this computational clock, thinking through what it can imagine and make time for, but also how this infinite imaginary of computed time has limits, and ones we imagined crip futures not only within, but also beyond.To en-crip the Unix clock here and now, we hacked these chronic cron jobs to be very disobedient and do things which they were never imagined to do by their deterministic norms. Cron jobs are \"always deterministically on time and up to date\"(Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025 ) but we hacked their code to make room for them to be \"somehow both late, early and on time\"(ibid.). We did this through the cron job code quoted from our essay below, working with computational poetics to form wiggle room in the variability of what these maintenance protocols do, and the bodies, times and horizons they are imagined to hold. From these frictions we felt within these maintenance protocols we disoriented them through our crip expertise. From these points of impact we cripped what these network infrastructures have capacity for when we interdependently care for their limits and constraints.\n\"So, when our chronic job declares\n* * * * * sleep $[RANDOM%69]m ; /home/cozy/chronic/job.sh\nit's saying:\n* = All the time and indefinite\nsleep = Rest as a valid (in)activity\nRANDOM = Indeterminacy\n69 = Interdependence, desire and pleasure\n/home/cozy/chronic/job.sh = Chronic care\" (Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025)\n<br>Through crip en-coding an indefinite indeterminate intimate and restful hack of a chronic cron job to the computational clock of the Cozy-Cloud we poetically cripped its chrononormative<a data-footref=\"610\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-c6bcd3c79903cf7b_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> relations here and now. This low level crip infrastructuring being the first on the Cozy-Cloud server, and in many ways crips the background for what can be made here.This cripping of computational intimacies is also en-coded through the \"cozy/chronic/job.sh\" script which is a modified version of the original shell script Mariana proposed. It still went through the poem of crip times, en-crip-ing and de-crip-ing it line by line, but to chronic this job we made it indeterminate, indefinite and non-linear. To do this we programmed it to chose a random line to en-crip or de-crip, indeterminate, which made room for it to go on forever, indefinite, and making a relationship where you have to come back repeatedly with care to get to know it, intimate. Here orienting this poetic crip infrastructure to en-cripped these network norms and bring readers in contact with radical practices and relations of crip time and care.<br>Towards the end of the essay Mariana and I oriented to reflect on the second cripping of the unix clock, and caring beyond its limits. This was as Mariana raised, this clock is nearing its determined bit limit and end of unix time in 2036. With this we made wiggle room to imagine a pluriverse<a data-footref=\"611\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-c6bcd3c79903cf7b_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a> of crip computational clocks that can start to approach networks that de-centre and relinquish control of \"what should happen on time\"(Kafer 2013). With this imaginary we welcomed a future abundant with the indefinite and indeterminate times we need to wiggle within the futures of these network infrastructures norms for crip futures to exist. <br>\"these temporal and structural norms I have called chrononormativity: causality, sequence, forward-moving agency, and so on\" (Freeman 2010)<a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-c6bcd3c79903cf7b_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"Arturo Escobar's&nbsp;Pluriversal Politics&nbsp;(2020) engages with the «politics of the possible,» exploring how dominant worldviews limit the imagination of radically different futures that would truly bring forth an epistemic transformation.

Here though we also recognised this as a barrier to access the work as it needed somewhat \"expert knowledge\" to do. Here when caring for this site of friction we deciding to reorient it from being in a terminal to being a html page that could be accessed online. In this move the work did retreat from the terminal (a bit), but also in doing so put it in contact the back end of this infrastructure and exchange online for people to connect to directly. Here instead of en-crip-ing a simple text file we moved directly to en-cip-ing a HTML file served up on the Cozy-Cloud. This move also crips the animated relations of normative web stack. HTML, which is a high level languages is normally isolated to work with other high level languages like css and js. In this work we disoriented this by configuring it to make edits to this page directly from Cozy-Cloud's low level chronicly Cripped times. In this motion crossing scales of infrastructures and making accessible and knowable the computational labour and matters that are hidden from this table.As the en-crip-ing scrip we had written, and many chronic illnesses, are both very indiscriminate this also made room to reflect on these cripping actions of infrastructures elsewhere. In particular, much of the formatting of HTML is hidden, but this chronic job did not have the capacity to care, and so en-cripped the &lt;head&gt;, the &lt;body&gt; and everything else in the file. Instead of trying to \"fix\" this, our crip expertise found this happy accident reflected much of the bodymind critiques of crip studies. Here when configuring it out we felt how this same dialogue can be taken to infrastructure, here making frictions within the relations of what is served, and how it is served up.Mariana with her (almost) infinite knowledge of feminist net art practices also brought into focus the \"early net-art and cyberfeminist works that reflected upon the structure of HTML&nbsp;as executable anthropomorphic metaphors, such as Mariela Yeregui's «Epithelia»&nbsp;and Talan Memmott's «Lexia to Perplexia.»\"(Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025). With these references offering how these two legacies, politics and practices of crip theory and feminist net art have already (always) overlapped, and how people have disoriented and made room for these infrastructures to be configure-able in relation to their situated embodied knowledges and expertise.\n07.03.03_En-crip-ing_kinshipAn essential part of the emergence of this crip infrastructure and also something we felt was important to share in the presentation of the work at mesh festival was the collaborative relation and interdependence it took to manifest this cripping of the server's clock. Behind the code, and \"between the&nbsp;&lt;li&gt;nes we see crips making space\"(Simms &amp; Marangoni, 2025), where in the html of the crip time poem, and for people to see we added comments of our messages of crip care and wigglings of rooms, that where an essential practice for this crip infrastructure to come into being. These messages mainly focused on us reorienting plans to be flexible to our capacities, of letting each other know what is too much and how we can re-approach our practise together so it is maintainable. It also shares the hope, joy and pleasure of taking care around these limits.<br>This part of the work may seem like quite a small thing to focus on but its impact on the cozy-cloud is much bigger. Shayda Kafai in Crip kinship reflects on these sorts of collective labours with Sins Invalid and brings focus to Kim TallBear's \"Good relation\"<a data-footref=\"612\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-76f20eee2e3127de_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. Good relation here aims to make room for the diverse intimacies and needs a community or person might have as well as orienting to building up to these capacities. It is also similar to what Mia Mingus calls access intimacy(2017), but both, as well as our actions here bring into focus the time, intimacy and care work it takes for disabled, neurodiverse and chronically ill people to collectivley orient towards their life affirming infrastructures. It also makes me reflect on Kafer quoting Bernice Johnson Reagon<a data-footref=\"613\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-2-76f20eee2e3127de_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, and thinking through how much extra work, labour, care, energy and emotion that it takes to be in coalition, no matter \"Good relation\" with others. This brings a focus to the amount of time I took to slow down, question and query the ways I am can care with and for others, both on the Cozy-Cloud and withing wider collaborations. Here though with Marianna we wiggled room into the computed tables of network infrastructure and HTML file our comments to hold our embodied knowledges, experiences and expertise of what made this infrastructure possible. <br>\"Informed by the knowledge of asexual polyamorists in her community Kim shares that intimacy can be \"being in good relation... intimacy is conversation... is sharing resources, is talking to one another, listening to one another, reassuring one another. Sex can be one among many ways of relating.\" When I envision what crip kinship can look like and what spaces it can create, I think about Kim's definitions of intimacy and how we, in our crip kinship systems, can be in good relation with one another. Good relation is asking what someone's access needs are, what someone's s pronouns are. Good relation is pod mapping, spoon check-ins, and care work. Good relation is understanding the collective access that is needed for all of us to thrive.\" (Kafai, 2021, p.&nbsp;120)<a href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fnref-1-76f20eee2e3127de_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>\"I feel as if i'm gonna keel over any minute and die.

Working with Kelsie Acton's Semi-Plain language (2023), In-grid and I did this so that these docs were not only accessible from different approaches and capacities, but to also distribute the expertise of these social and technical infrastructures. In the accompanying essay to the En-crip-ing time infrastructure/artwork, called En-crip-ing Time: How to Care for&amp;with a SexCI Chronic Job (2025), Mariana and I inquired into how we could similarly approach the sedimented formats of academic essays and practice to wiggle room into their sedimented code, practices and capacity to manifest this crip infrastructure. Doing this we disoriented these technologies as a way to crip these individualises relations of practice and theory, plan and action, paper and code, to not divided them but make room to coalesce them together at one table. This was in a very playful, poetic and joyful expression of how these two complex institutionally configured formats of technical docs and academic texts can meet. Here figuring out what impression these two discipline make upon one another when in touch. In this contact we manifested room for these bodies to form questions around what kinds of variability they need both to be in touch.\n07.04_Futures_x_DesiresIt is hard to say a lot in reflection when the Cozy-Cloud still has so much going on in the present and planned for the future. I can say though that as this cozier looking cloud comes into reach on my horizon, it is starting to feel a lil more snug. These projects have oriented the initial configure-able actions of the Cozy-Cloud, that of making wiggle room within network infrastructures norm for life affirming crip network infrastructures to emerge actions of critical access. In this orientation I have shares how collaborators and I have tried to crip network infrastructuring practices through the embodied frictions we felt when being in contact with them. This has been by both cripping the social and technical relations of these network infrastructures through inquiring into how the sediment limits and contours of these practices made room for our bodily horizons in practice, or not. From these points of impact and friction we made room for us to develop conceptual and critical infrastructures that disorient this misfitting background's figures, relations, politics and times right now. This inquiry into a configure-able Cozy-Cloud has, as I have shared in this chapter, manifested a few outcomes. Firstly a Crip feeling and figuring out as method, here orienting retreating from institutional norms, but in doing so questioning how and caring for what radical imaginaries we bring into contact with these institutions when we do. Here with the retreat as crip manifestation, acknowledging that we can never really escape these institutions, even when you leave like Ahmed(2016). In this retreat though, like Ahmed, we thought about what we surfaced, how we de-sediment these lines and brought Crip/marginalized issues onto the bodily horizon of both computing and academia. More importantly though is also that we gained agency over on our own bodily horizons, getting to become intimate and well within reach of our infrastructures. With this aiming to de-center the expertise within roles to gain flexibility within our actions, intentions, and futures.<br>Now orienting into the present and these futures, the Cozy-Cloud is slowly building up a community of members at a gentle pace. In this orientation we are now focused on how to make it accessible to a wider disability community as well as working out protocols to work together. Technically this has been enacted by re-doing the website to make it a little less technically fritcious, more accessible and multi-user friendly, by moving it to Bludit CMS<a data-footref=\"641\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods.html#fn-1-0f3d9611cb8da6fa_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>. This has a combination of flexibility for users, as well as good documentation, and being relatively lightweight/low energy both for the server and receiver. To build this up I also designed a custom theme for it called <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy_Night+Day/Cozy_Night+Day.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Cozy_Night+Day</a>, that not only very light weight and has a cozy light and dark mode, but more importantly is encoded to automatically pick up text with an easy reader to make it even more accessible. We have also opened up for collaborations on the server through a form for crip community to host websites, infrastructures and services for free on the server. From a social side this for me has been a lot of slowing down, having patience and not feeling my \"normative\" webdev and super user urges to manage situations and prescribe problems, and instead orient to making wiggle room for one another to be experts, and reassuring each other that this is fine to take our sweet crip ass time to gently move towards these futures of life affirming accessible network infrastructures.As we build up towards the future together slowly, asynchronously, all over the place but also together right now, I am very content to keep orienting towards crip coziness. Here making room to work independently through the frictions we feel when being together within these technologies. Manifesting Coziness not only as a practice to care for the frictions of the day, but also as a promise and a destination at the end of many long days, weeks, years and life-times. <br><a

In conversations we wanted to question how we could make a chaotic dataset of hand written letters to form our own dataset and generate a local dataset of fonts with our intentions and contexts entangled into them. This data set explored how we could disorient the standardised norms of AI datasets such as the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" target=\"_self\">MNIST</a> (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) by trying to de-isolate and un-normalize their indexes and figures by situating them, bringing in their backgrounds and entangling them together.

In the interface for doing this it also made room for people to add intentions for their data as well as their name and bits about their background. I wrote this in python and used a rdflib to write a custom linked open data (LOD) dataset that entangled the images to this data through semantic triples. This was informed by a workshopI attended called Fermenting Data1 by Magdalena Tyżlik-Carver, Lozana Rossenova and Lukas Fuchsgruber, where they made room within the semantic triples of LOD to form and unfold different relations in data.This project didn't make it past being a pipeline mainly due to two frictions. The first that at this point I had not focused on a technical practice that was very shareable or accessible to my collaborators, and so it lost momentum. The second was that this would have been best served online, as this would make room for the dataset to unfold as it was added to, but none of us had those technical skills and so it stayed scanned/paper base. In this reflection though the work did make room for me to question in collaboration the ways we could imagine and store data in more nuanced and situated ways to try and trouble the ways AI and ML are approached.<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/01_background/f*mnist_dataset/f*mnist_dataset.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["08_practice/01_background/f*mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.html"],"createdTime":1756048612942,"modifiedTime":1756048612942,"sourceSize":2301,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/01_Background/F*MNIST_Dataset/F*MNIST_Dataset.md","exportPath":"08_practice/01_background/f*mnist_dataset/f*mnist_dataset.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html":{"title":"neural representation","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.gif\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html"],"createdTime":1756048613104,"modifiedTime":1756048613245,"sourceSize":12294664,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/01_Background/Neural_Re-Presentation/media/neural representation.gif","exportPath":"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/neural-re-presentation.html":{"title":"Neural Re-Presentation","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.gif\" target=\"_self\">This work explored working with Reinforcement Learning agents, specifically multi-agent environments. In these environments inquiring through practice the relations these agents were able to make together and what where their capacities to learn and represent their environment. In this setup, which is one of a few I made, I oriented them to be able to communicate through a visual layer together whilst trying to navigate a simple task of not touching, but staying close to one another. The visual layer that they produced was their only mode of feedback to the environment and oriented them to form a visual language to communicate through, and one in which the viewer can intercept their communications.<br>This work was presented at 4S 2023, as part of their making and doing exhibition and received nice feedback from the community there. I did end up stopping to work with these agents for a few reasons, mainly because of some of the critiques I make in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\"01_introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_background.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction.

In these environments inquiring through practice the relations these agents were able to make together and what where their capacities to learn and represent their environment. In this setup, which is one of a few I made, I oriented them to be able to communicate through a visual layer together whilst trying to navigate a simple task of not touching, but staying close to one another. The visual layer that they produced was their only mode of feedback to the environment and oriented them to form a visual language to communicate through, and one in which the viewer can intercept their communications.<br>This work was presented at 4S 2023, as part of their making and doing exhibition and received nice feedback from the community there. I did end up stopping to work with these agents for a few reasons, mainly because of some of the critiques I make in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../../01_Introduction/01_entries/01.01.00_Background.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">01.01.00_Background</a> of the introduction.

The work came about from collaborating with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://meganbenson.me/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://meganbenson.me/\" target=\"_self\">Meg Benson</a> and <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://yasminmorgan.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://yasminmorgan.com/\" target=\"_self\">Yasmin Morgan</a>. In conversations we wanted to question how we could make a chaotic dataset of hand written letters to form our own dataset and generate a local dataset of fonts with our intentions and contexts entangled into them. This data set explored how we could disorient the standardised norms of AI datasets such as the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\" target=\"_self\">MNIST</a> (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) by trying to de-isolate and un-normalize their indexes and figures by situating them, bringing in their backgrounds and entangling them together. We also left space within the inputs for people to add their own symbols and data outside of the limits of the Latin alphabet. <br><img src=\"08_practice/01_background/f*mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.gif\" target=\"_self\">This work did this technically by scanning in hand written samples on paper and splitting them into the different segments. In the interface for doing this it also made room for people to add intentions for their data as well as their name and bits about their background. I wrote this in python and used a rdflib to write a custom linked open data (LOD) dataset that entangled the images to this data through semantic triples. This was informed by a workshopI attended called Fermenting Data1 by Magdalena Tyżlik-Carver, Lozana Rossenova and Lukas Fuchsgruber, where they made room within the semantic triples of LOD to form and unfold different relations in data.This project didn't make it past being a pipeline mainly due to two frictions. The first that at this point I had not focused on a technical practice that was very shareable or accessible to my collaborators, and so it lost momentum. The second was that this would have been best served online, as this would make room for the dataset to unfold as it was added to, but none of us had those technical skills and so it stayed scanned/paper base. In this reflection though the work did make room for me to question in collaboration the ways we could imagine and store data in more nuanced and situated ways to try and trouble the ways AI and ML are approached.<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing\" target=\"_self\">https://github.com/CorsicAr/DataProccessing</a>F*MNIST_Dataset","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Neural Re-Presentation","level":1,"id":"Neural_Re-Presentation_0"},{"heading":"Sentinel Self","level":1,"id":"Sentinel_Self_0"},{"heading":"F*MNIST_Dataset","level":1,"id":"F*MNIST_Dataset_0"}],"links":[".html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/01_background/08.01_background_canvas.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["08_practice/01_background/neural_re-presentation/media/neural-representation.html","08_practice/01_background/sentinel_self/media/pasted-image-20250821111813.html","08_practice/01_background/f*mnist_dataset/media/fmnist_dataset.html"],"createdTime":1756048612942,"modifiedTime":1756048612942,"sourceSize":727,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/01_Background/08.01_Background_canvas.canvas","exportPath":"08_practice/01_background/08.01_background_canvas.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"canvas"},"08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.html":{"title":"Configure-Able_infra_poster","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.html"],"createdTime":1756048613250,"modifiedTime":1756048613255,"sourceSize":699936,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/02_Configure-able/media/Configure-Able_infra_poster.png","exportPath":"08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"08_practice/02_configure-able/configure-able_infrastructures.html":{"title":"Configure-able_Infrastructures","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"08_practice/02_configure-able/media/configure-able_infra_poster.png\" target=\"_self\">These workshops were organised with NEoN digital to make room to explore queer, feminist and crip methods towards network infrastructures.

This is where we have made room within and around these hard network infrastructures with and for our softer practices of collective access.

The focus will be accessible to member's reorientation but it will be a time for us to look back and reflect on how we have started to configure our own infrastructure and background away from big tech institutions and towards feminist and intersectional community infrastructures. In this reflection I hope for us to articulate together through processing our inquiry, a few figures (metaphors) of our own to make accessible these situated relations. To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflex when working socially and technically. These will form contours for us to reflect on how we have enabled our collaboration to be in-flex-able together. This interplay being the place we form figures and narratives of access from, and where we as a collaboration have flexed towards accessible futures and away from institutional inflex.\nGo over questions for G\nDefine together inflex and in-flex + qs to help us think through them.\nFeel out some topics or experiences to reflect on the inflex and then our in-flex-ability.\nWhat are the systematic and institutional relations that hold/held us in place? From Ahmed - lines holding norms of relations in place. + Aimi Hamraie Flexibile users and soft bodies being conformed to hard machines. Systemic issues around CAPITALISM aside. University structure, jobs/working relationships hold some elements in place, and enable certain actions. Institutions, these come with some privileges but academia/large institutions can be ableist, smaller grass roots organisations that are not driven by the logics of capitalism can enable alt spaces. How we stay attached to these institutions or stay with the difficulties of systemic issues, but find wiggle room, how we make wiggle room. All the other things, like race, class, gender etc etc etc Social and also contractual relationships Time = money under the jobbing job world. And collectivising means we can pool time or labour in a time-poor world. The Catch 22 of being able to prioritise art/research/things that matter for early career researchers/artists/makers is that you already have to have done these things to get the jobs/roles where you are given time for that. Post-austerity efficiency\nWhat are the things that disable(d) us from doing what we desire(d) in that relation? Time, space, funding, prestige, brain space, emotional capacity Dumb systems that's difficult to work with (Ex: No bank options for non- profitable small collective) Working as a collective, that is not a business or a charity or an institution, makes it difficult to interface with other bodies. Transitioning from a group of individuals to a group that is legally definable? Right to work, visas etc wage labour slavery &amp; and chronic health un-diagnosis that both disable/enable my capacity to do anything whether for work or socially, or towrds organising/meeting/ etc What restrains/ed our capacities relationally and materially?\naccountability to each other as a group\ndefining the boundaries of the group. intimacy / maintaining intimacy (is protecting too intense a word), while balancing openness. Project Grant Funding topics (not for this focus group). Maybe we need to be more strict about who we are inviting in and for how long, what the accountabilities etc\nexpectations from others in terms of availability/ capacity\nWhat does this friction contour?\nWanting to be open but additionally needing some static for contracts and stuff\nToo much admin workload on a few people when having more flexible form/ infrastructure\nHow do/did we process and feel out that restraint?\nAccept what works for the moment and being honest about the solution and the restraint\nHow did we (want to) flex and wiggle towards our desires?What did we do to enable us to get close to the space/relation possible that we needed?How would we have changed or approached this differently?

Do add or edit if you feel they misrepresent or you have q's or other opinions. . . talks about my approach with Ahmed and Kafer to think about crip intersectional manifestings as a way to orient other paths towards life affirmation and disability justice. It takes the crip approach of imperfect manfistings that take practice and care, in their imperfection form bodies on horizons to orient from/to together.Talking about my methodology of disobedient action-research. This focuses on action research that moves beyond the scales of institutions and derives from direct actions into forming relations, infrastructures and imaginaries together. It also routes itself within first person action research, forming dialogues that entangle internal feelings and politics, with external actions and relations.This is a mapping of an internal arc of the research, and starts to re-orient critical access and configuration methods by brining them into contact with each other. In bringing them into contact I aim to see what impression they make on each other and how we can rethink access as a relational configuration practice and configuration practices as material/political processes.(Hamraie, 2017) - <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6\" target=\"_self\">https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6</a>.Writes about the formation of the figure of the user within industrial design and how this was formed from the understanding that human bodies are soft and malleable unlike machines, which are hard, determined and static things humans have to be shaped around.

As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.Not users but:maintainers?carers?Member?Players?Collaborators and caretakersit is nice to be individuals in a collectivecharactersConversationalistspersonaInfra as another collaborator not users/usingFistulas Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives.

In this exchange we will materially and technically setup a server space, and along that journey together we will ask questions and discuss&nbsp;how we want to practice these technologies collectively.The end goal is to have collectively edited set of protocols or a manifesto that we publish to an html page on the server.Material for this workshop was developed from collaborative work over a number of iterations from projects including servpub, collective infrastructures and cozy-cloud.Outcomes from this workshop will also be used in my PhD as well as published in the new Servus journal? (I think it is) And I will make sure we are all credited!This workshop and the server are hosted by Servus in Linx Austria. They are an artist run data centre and have given us this space to practice our own network tech and projects. It is run on hydro electric energy and hosts a number of other collectives, tech enthusiasts and artists.We will be making and editing a manifesto of sorts as we work through the steps of this workshop. These will be hosted on an html file on the server, and is accessible at this URL page: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io/</a><br>Until then we will edit them on this pad: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester\" target=\"_self\">https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester</a>\np.s. Femfester can be changed.\nWhen it comes to making collaborative community driven sociotechnical infrastructure, there is always a complex network of relations that we have to work through. Negotiating every relation when we enter a space could be very complex and time consuming, as we will see, but setting protocols helps us firm up ways of working and relational conventions that ease this flow. Through setting these protocols together we mean to disobey the norms of network infrastructures and actively re-scope how we come to these systems and relations together.<br><img src=\"08_practice/03_in-grid/serving-in-grid/media/servpubdiagram2024.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Relating to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" target=\"_self\">original feminist server manifesto</a> by some of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" target=\"_self\">Constant</a>.

This is great for accessibility but also tends to scope and direct the abilities and capacities you have on your computer, as in there are only so many buttons or things you can show in a communicable way. <br><img alt=\"howdy.png\" src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/media/howdyterminal.png\" target=\"_self\">Terminal is a more classic way of working with a machine, and roughly speaking is the step between punch-card/magnetic tape style computing and a GUI. It is a very simple but powerful interface that lets you run basically any command on your system through a text interface. Compared to a GUI this space is more \"risky\" as you can do anything from anywhere, such as deleting the entire operating system (not advised). It also means that there are no limitations to your system administration so you have access to a granular level of working. Prompt\nWhen entering into this more \"risky\" space on a computer network, it is good to set some intentions and work out how to move through this space with care. As we go though these next steps getting into terminal have a think about what it means to be in this place of power/risk, and what relations you think you need to care for in the formation of these protocols?\nIt can also be a great place to think about if/how the relations of a system enables you to perform this role of power, and what change in relations this new role brings with it. This depends on your platform, so...On a Mac it is already installed! So all you need to do is:\nSearch up Terminal\nOpen it!\nThere are similar programs to terminal already installed, but not the same language (bash). There are a few ways to do this, but I recomend installing an ubuntu vm shell for bash, as it gives the most capability for this use case:\n<br>Install the VM from the windows store <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>and remember your password!\nThen open it up!\nAs we said before terminal is a text/syntax-based way of interfacing your machine and we are going to introduce a few basic commands and concepts to get us going today.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"(¬_¬)/` Serv(er)ing In-grid","level":1,"id":"(¬_¬)/\\`_Serv(er)ing_In-grid_0"},{"heading":"Workshop Outline","level":1,"id":"Workshop_Outline_0"},{"heading":"Workshop Acknowledgements","level":2,"id":"Workshop_Acknowledgements_0"},{"heading":"Infrastructural Acknowledgements","level":2,"id":"Infrastructural_Acknowledgements_0"},{"heading":"Femfester?","level":2,"id":"Femfester?_0"},{"heading":"Protocols * Manifesto","level":3,"id":"Protocols_\\*_Manifesto_0"},{"heading":"Why thinking through protocols?","level":3,"id":"Why_thinking_through_protocols?_0"},{"heading":"Diagram: of socio-technical relations of Servpub project","level":4,"id":"Diagram_of_socio-technical_relations_of_Servpub_project_0"},{"heading":"Why thinking through Manifesto?","level":4,"id":"Why_thinking_through_Manifesto?_0"},{"heading":"Why Femfester tho?","level":2,"id":"Why_Femfester_tho?_0"},{"heading":"Lets put it to practice","level":1,"id":"Lets_put_it_to_practice_0"},{"heading":"Pre word","level":1,"id":"Pre_word_0"},{"heading":"1.

As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.Not users but:maintainers?carers?Member?Players?Collaborators and caretakersit is nice to be individuals in a collectivecharactersConversationalistspersonaInfra as another collaborator not users/usingFistulas Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.New things: Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment\nDoes not police language, but reads intentions and actionsForm different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from.

The focus will be accessible to member's reorientation but it will be a time for us to look back and reflect on how we have started to configure our own infrastructure and background away from big tech institutions and towards feminist and intersectional community infrastructures. In this reflection I hope for us to articulate together through processing our inquiry, a few figures (metaphors) of our own to make accessible these situated relations. To do this we will think through how we have found frictions, or inflex when working socially and technically. These will form contours for us to reflect on how we have enabled our collaboration to be in-flex-able together. This interplay being the place we form figures and narratives of access from, and where we as a collaboration have flexed towards accessible futures and away from institutional inflex.\nGo over questions for G\nDefine together inflex and in-flex + qs to help us think through them.\nFeel out some topics or experiences to reflect on the inflex and then our in-flex-ability.\nWhat are the systematic and institutional relations that hold/held us in place? From Ahmed - lines holding norms of relations in place. + Aimi Hamraie Flexibile users and soft bodies being conformed to hard machines. Systemic issues around CAPITALISM aside. University structure, jobs/working relationships hold some elements in place, and enable certain actions. Institutions, these come with some privileges but academia/large institutions can be ableist, smaller grass roots organisations that are not driven by the logics of capitalism can enable alt spaces. How we stay attached to these institutions or stay with the difficulties of systemic issues, but find wiggle room, how we make wiggle room. All the other things, like race, class, gender etc etc etc Social and also contractual relationships Time = money under the jobbing job world. And collectivising means we can pool time or labour in a time-poor world. The Catch 22 of being able to prioritise art/research/things that matter for early career researchers/artists/makers is that you already have to have done these things to get the jobs/roles where you are given time for that. Post-austerity efficiency\nWhat are the things that disable(d) us from doing what we desire(d) in that relation? Time, space, funding, prestige, brain space, emotional capacity Dumb systems that's difficult to work with (Ex: No bank options for non- profitable small collective) Working as a collective, that is not a business or a charity or an institution, makes it difficult to interface with other bodies. Transitioning from a group of individuals to a group that is legally definable? Right to work, visas etc wage labour slavery &amp; and chronic health un-diagnosis that both disable/enable my capacity to do anything whether for work or socially, or towrds organising/meeting/ etc What restrains/ed our capacities relationally and materially?\naccountability to each other as a group\ndefining the boundaries of the group. intimacy / maintaining intimacy (is protecting too intense a word), while balancing openness. Project Grant Funding topics (not for this focus group). Maybe we need to be more strict about who we are inviting in and for how long, what the accountabilities etc\nexpectations from others in terms of availability/ capacity\nWhat does this friction contour?\nWanting to be open but additionally needing some static for contracts and stuff\nToo much admin workload on a few people when having more flexible form/ infrastructure\nHow do/did we process and feel out that restraint?\nAccept what works for the moment and being honest about the solution and the restraint\nHow did we (want to) flex and wiggle towards our desires?What did we do to enable us to get close to the space/relation possible that we needed?How would we have changed or approached this differently?

Do add or edit if you feel they misrepresent or you have q's or other opinions. . . talks about my approach with Ahmed and Kafer to think about crip intersectional manifestings as a way to orient other paths towards life affirmation and disability justice. It takes the crip approach of imperfect manfistings that take practice and care, in their imperfection form bodies on horizons to orient from/to together.Talking about my methodology of disobedient action-research. This focuses on action research that moves beyond the scales of institutions and derives from direct actions into forming relations, infrastructures and imaginaries together. It also routes itself within first person action research, forming dialogues that entangle internal feelings and politics, with external actions and relations.This is a mapping of an internal arc of the research, and starts to re-orient critical access and configuration methods by brining them into contact with each other. In bringing them into contact I aim to see what impression they make on each other and how we can rethink access as a relational configuration practice and configuration practices as material/political processes.<br>(Hamraie, 2017) - <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6\" target=\"_self\">https://doi.org/10.5749/j.ctt1pwt79d.6</a>.Writes about the formation of the figure of the user within industrial design and how this was formed from the understanding that human bodies are soft and malleable unlike machines, which are hard, determined and static things humans have to be shaped around.

How can we be frank about discussions while also protecting the trust within the group? Do you have consent forms for us as individuals around how we’d like the names of ourselves and/or our affiliations named in any write-ups or storage of notes / transcripts? A: I have forms and information sheets I will share with you via email before the session which explain a lot of this. I also will share any writing up with you for approval esp if you are mentioned by name. All notes will be in this pad, but will also be stored in the cloud and held according to GDPR. In-fra_processing working padWill add picIn this workshop I aim for us to think about how we make and imagine collective places of infrastructure. In this exchange we will materially and technically setup a server space, and along that journey together we will ask questions and discuss&nbsp;how we want to practice these technologies collectively.The end goal is to have collectively edited set of protocols or a manifesto that we publish to an html page on the server.Material for this workshop was developed from collaborative work over a number of iterations from projects including servpub, collective infrastructures and cozy-cloud.Outcomes from this workshop will also be used in my PhD as well as published in the new Servus journal? (I think it is) And I will make sure we are all credited!This workshop and the server are hosted by Servus in Linx Austria. They are an artist run data centre and have given us this space to practice our own network tech and projects. It is run on hydro electric energy and hosts a number of other collectives, tech enthusiasts and artists.We will be making and editing a manifesto of sorts as we work through the steps of this workshop. <br>These will be hosted on an html file on the server, and is accessible at this URL page: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io/</a><br>Until then we will edit them on this pad: <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester\" target=\"_self\">https://digitalcare.noho.st/pad/p/Femfester</a>\np.s. Femfester can be changed.\nWhen it comes to making collaborative community driven sociotechnical infrastructure, there is always a complex network of relations that we have to work through. Negotiating every relation when we enter a space could be very complex and time consuming, as we will see, but setting protocols helps us firm up ways of working and relational conventions that ease this flow. Through setting these protocols together we mean to disobey the norms of network infrastructures and actively re-scope how we come to these systems and relations together.<br><img src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/servpubdiagram2024.png\" target=\"_self\"><br>Relating to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" target=\"_self\">original feminist server manifesto</a> by some of <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://constantvzw.org/\" target=\"_self\">Constant</a>.

This is great for accessibility but also tends to scope and direct the abilities and capacities you have on your computer, as in there are only so many buttons or things you can show in a communicable way. <br><img alt=\"howdy.png\" src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/howdyterminal.png\" target=\"_self\">Terminal is a more classic way of working with a machine, and roughly speaking is the step between punch-card/magnetic tape style computing and a GUI. It is a very simple but powerful interface that lets you run basically any command on your system through a text interface. Compared to a GUI this space is more \"risky\" as you can do anything from anywhere, such as deleting the entire operating system (not advised). It also means that there are no limitations to your system administration so you have access to a granular level of working. Prompt\nWhen entering into this more \"risky\" space on a computer network, it is good to set some intentions and work out how to move through this space with care. As we go though these next steps getting into terminal have a think about what it means to be in this place of power/risk, and what relations you think you need to care for in the formation of these protocols?\nIt can also be a great place to think about if/how the relations of a system enables you to perform this role of power, and what change in relations this new role brings with it. This depends on your platform, so...On a Mac it is already installed! So all you need to do is:\nSearch up Terminal\nOpen it!\nThere are similar programs to terminal already installed, but not the same language (bash). There are a few ways to do this, but I recomend installing an ubuntu vm shell for bash, as it gives the most capability for this use case:\n<br>Install the VM from the windows store <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV?ocid=pdpshare\" target=\"_self\">HERE</a>and remember your password!\nThen open it up!\nAs we said before terminal is a text/syntax-based way of interfacing your machine and we are going to introduce a few basic commands and concepts to get us going today.Let's simply use echo to get our terminal to say HI!.To do this use:echo &lt;message&gt;\ne.g.echo HI!\nNow lets see who your computer!Show the name of the currently logged in user:whoami\nShow the name of the machine is given on the network:hostname\nMuch of working on the command line involves navigating around your system without the use of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).However, we will essentially be navigating around normal computer folder hierarchies like below:root/\n├─ directoryname/ ├─ anotherdirectory/ ├─ aFileName.txt\nDirectory&nbsp;: also known as a folderPrint working directory that you are currently in:pwd\nList current directory contents:ls\nNow to move between directories/folders we use cd like socd &lt;directory_name&gt;\ne.g.cd folder1 We can use a folder that was shown with ls in the last step!\nYou can also check whats in the new folder with ls to see that you have moved.\nPrompt\nIn this potentially unfamiliar space how do we keep track of where we are, what we've done &amp; what commands we may need in the future?\nBasically how do we want to orient ourselves?\nSecure Shell (SSH) is a way of working on another machine from your own, working in their shell (bash). It basically lets you work on another computers terminal remotely. This is the way you will work on most servers or remote/faceless computers (computers without a screen).<br><img src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/sshdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The SSH protocol enables us to talk securely to our server by encrypting and authenticating all of our communication/interfacing through the network. Traditionally tech has a metaphor of SSH as a secure hand shake protocol, but it will be great to think about what metaphor or relation we want when it comes to crossing boundaries and into shared spaces. Do we want to hand shake or do we think . . . would enable . . . Again this may be a bit different on different systems, as some will have this already installed and some will need to install it. Install it with:sudo apt install openssh-client\nIf you are on gitbash on windows, it should be installed.To SSH into the Server with servus we need to use their IP!An IP address is basically the postcode/address we will find the pi at on the network.The IP for our Servus server is:\n193.170.194.204But we also have it as a named server:\nvps.in-grid.ioNow that we have the IP address, any computer can request to SSH into the server through these commands:ssh &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;ip&gt;\neg.ssh in-grid@193.170.194.204\norssh in-grid@vps.in-grid.io\nYou are now \"logging into\" our server, so it will ask for the password here and that I will share with you.You should now see your terminal username change from your laptop's local user to something like: in-grid@vps:~$ If you want to exit out of the pi (we don't atm) type:exit\nHit enter. You will need to have exited the pi before setting up your ssh key. Prompt\nHow do we navigate another machine through our own \"interface\"?\nWhat are the relational agreements to being on this other machine?\nSudo enables us to take on a superuser role.\nThis means that we have all the security permissions for that system. This is a \"very risky\" role, as here you can do anything on the server/computer. With sudo you can actually delete the entire system or make other similar drastic commands, but it also means that we have the ability to manage and configure our system to our needs.When we come to writing protocols for sudo, what does it mean for us to be a \"superuser\" or an admin, and what care and consideration should we take on in these protocols?<br><img src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/usersdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">To become sudo or root you just need to:sudo su\nAnd then enter the password when prompted.Prompt\nSuper User can Do! a lot... what permissions are we comfortable navigating?\nHow intimate are we with our machines?\nCaring for a server includes routine tasks like updating/upgrading the system software, tiding up files, creating new users &amp; giving access permissions, paying attention to errors and bug reports.We are going to initiate this server by making us all users!<br><img src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/usersdiagram.jpg\" target=\"_self\">To make a new user, use the command below. Note, that you will be prompted to input a password and it is always better to give different users passwordsadduser &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nIf you want to give this user sudo access, then they have to be added to the \"sudo\" group. You don't need to create this group, it exists by default and you can just add or remove users from it. The sudo group is stored in this directory: /etc/sudoers.d/usermod -aG sudo &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nYou can check to see who is in the group sudo using this command: grep '^sudo:.*$' /etc/group\nNow you can change into the new user (in other words, sign into their account):su &lt;nameofuser&gt;\nYou could also log in now with:ssh &lt;username&gt;@193.170.194.204\norssh &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nAnd log in with the password you just added.Prompt\nHow can we re-imagine users to something less explicit and more gentle?\nHow do we want to configure the imaginaries to these roles?\nSSH Keys are user specific and are used in addition to a shared login password. To make this method of access truly secure we will need to eventually disable password-only login. The shared password is the Lock, and the private password is the Key. Keys are non-transferable and have to be generated per user. Make sure you are back on your own system with:exit\nThen to generate the keys, call this command: ssh-keygen -t rsa\nFill in the information requested (note: most of it is optional so you can leave it blank) and set a password (not optional).The shared key is the:id_rsa.puband the private Key is the:id_rsa Make note of the path to your id_rsa.pub, we'll need it in the next step.The public, Lock, password now needs to be copied over to the raspberry pi. Do this via this command (replacing the first bracket with the path to the id_rsa.pub, and the second to the Pis IP address, which we found earlier):ssh-copy-id -i &lt;path to id_rsa.pub&gt; &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nEnter password to complete transfer.I find it easiest to login with the key linked directly.sudo ssh -i &lt;path/to/id_rsa.pub&gt; &lt;username&gt;@vps.in-grid.io\nNote\nMaybe check you can become sudo with sudo su\nOnly do this after everyone who need to access the server has uploaded their Keys!It is also recommended that you keep one person ssh'd in at all times during testing this, so if you do something wrong you can unlock it again.Access the config file by:sudo nano -l /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nAnd in uncomment 'PasswordAuthentication' on line 57 and set to 'no', then save and exit:PasswordAuthentication no\nThen restart the SSH connection:sudo service ssh restart\nKeep someone logged in at all times!Have someone else log out and back in, trying with a password which should fail, and then the key which should work!Prompt\nNow this server is \"safe\" and secure, can we reflect on what that means to us?\nHow do we imagine this server being a safe space beyond SSH keys?\nTmux is what is called a multiplexer, which is a software that lets us collectively work one terminal session. This is how many collectives and collaborative networks work together on servers in one space. It lets us edit and run commands in one space and take responsibility and practice our infra becoming together.When we come to writing protocols we might want to think about what it means to be one user together, and how can we keep everyone at the same pace and comfortable levels of understanding. All become sudo with:sudo su\nNow we are all sudo we can initiate a shared session to work in together.To do this we use:tmux new -s &lt;session name&gt;\ne.g. tmux new -s in-sesh\nNow we need to name our collective space. If we think back*forward in this workshop, what are the intentions, dynamics and relations we want to collectively name this space with?Now we have an active session we can join it by just typing:tmux a -t in-sesh Rember we have to be sudo to join this!\nNow we can say hi to one another and say cute messages in the space by:echo &lt;message&gt;\nSay something to welcome each other into this session, you may need to take turns.As we saw even each of us writing an echo command takes a little bit of choreographing. When this gets more complicated, like writing complex configuration files, you can imagine it gets even more tricky.Prompt\nSo here we need to think about how we might manage collective editing. What operational metaphor might we use to describe the relationship between the person typing and the others? Who and how do we choose to type? How do we take care of every voice in that conversation?\nWe've created a simple html document to edit. We need to navigate to that file, open and edit it. First lets navigate to the folder its inside and list its contents.cd /var/www/femfester\nls\nWe should see a file called:index.html`Now we are in the right folder we can edit the file with nano which is a terminal base text editor. To open the file with nano we do:nano index.html\nThis will open the file in the terminal.<br><img src=\"thesis/workshops/serv(er)ing-in-grid/serv(er)ing/media/nanoofhtml.png\" target=\"_self\">Tip\nBeing terminal you have to navigate with the keyboard, and also copy and past by right clicking (not \"CNTRL+C/P\")\nFrom here we can then add text and images using basic HTML syntax.For the time being we are going to just add fun bits to see it work, as we have some more protocols to write and add.So for now add a message or paste in some ascii art with the help of these links:<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://www.patorjk.com/software/taag/\" target=\"_self\">ascii text gen</a><br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ascii-art-generator.org/\" target=\"_self\">ascii image gen</a>Remember to paste in with a right click!Now if we return to the file online at:<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io</a>we will see our beautiful inputs.prompt\nHow do we negotiate the space of working collectively as one user?\nWhat other considerations need to be voiced?\nWhen we finish up working together there are lots of things we can do to make it easier to return to our work, make it legible to others, as well as caring for the infrastructure we're working in. This could include careful documentation, understanding how to save and record edits, and exiting programs in their nuanced ways.We've finished working together and now we would like to leave our TMUX session. This is a little more complex than it might appear. Leaving a session using an 'exit' command will delete the session for others, and you will lose the record of your edits together. Instead we can either:Close the entire terminal session window, or use Ctrl-b. This will retain the terminal session for you to use again in the future. Let's consider collectively how to ensure we exit safely, using a door rather than an ejector seat. How does this action differ from exiting other softwares and how does this attention affect our relationships.prompt\nHow can we form protocols that enable us to care for who is coming next and which Now we have all the protocols ready lets add them to the HTML file with nano again.Once we have edited the HTML, we can launch our page in a browser! <br>At <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://femfester.in-grid.io/\" target=\"_self\">https://femfester.in-grid.io/</a>Practising infrastructuring collectively can be (intentionally) a slow, careful and unscalable process, so it's important to acknowledge our incremental changes, achievements and presence. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:00_Contents#Index_of_Sections\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://wiki4print.servpub.net/index.php?title=Docs:00_Contents#Index_of_Sections\" target=\"_self\">Our (ongoing) documentation</a>\nServing In-grid Workshop slides<br>This femfester is In-grid’s iteration of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://areyoubeingserved.constantvzw.org/Summit_afterlife.xhtml\" target=\"_self\">feminist server manifesto</a>. As we rub up against and dance our way into network practices, a festering acts as a place to form intentions and imagine how we want to collectively meet here. We fester as we care for the holes in our pipelines, tend to the ooze that undulates out and sit with these leaky seamful infrastructures. We don't aim to cure these frictions or plug these holes, but to care for them. We ask how we can enable infrastructuring to fester otherwise from our pulsating practices? A femfestering Server . . . . . - Is a situated technology. The server feels out their context and considers themselves to be part of an ecology of practices. - Is maintained by a community that cares enough for the frictions of accessing and maintaining a server, and where these frictions feel like a generative affair. - Ferments the materiality of software, hardware and the relations of the bodies gathered around them. - Opens themselves to expose the difficult processes, tools, sources, habits and patterns to make accessible these difficulties. - Does not strive for seamlessness, as it creates a bubble. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible and inaccessible. - Avoids efficiency, ease-of-use, scalability and immediacy because they can be cages we need to abolish. - Knows that networking is actually an awkward, promiscuous, interdependent and pleasurable practice. - Is autonomous in that they feel out their own dependencies, relations and politics. - Radically questions the conditions for serving and service; practices queering client-server relations where they can. - Approaches network technology and sociotechnical systems as places of social change. - Enables networks and their practices to be improvise-able and read-write accessible. - Does not confuse safety with security. - Takes the risk of exposing their insecurity. - Tries hard not to apologies when they are not available, as they learn to communicate their capacities. In-grid is a trans*feminist collective of artists/musicians/educators/hackers working with*for accessible digital infrastructures. In-grid has been working together since 2019, and is made up of a fluid group of people who bring together exhibitions, infrastructures, parties, workshops and research projects.In the workshop to write the Femfester, In-grid members came together in person and online, ate some nice food and tasty snacks, caught up, but also set up their new server with Servus, and along the way (con)figured out what relations and politics we wanted to bring there and how!These are the prompts we made alongside setting up our VPS server with our members. Each step we reflect, re-imagine, and re(con)figure out what we desire each relation, space and dynamic to be for us together. These were done to enable us to find our collective orientation whilst orienting our infrastructures. These are all notes of much deeper and complex conversations, but try to map and inform where we are at.Here was a pre-figuring out of what we desired our coding relations to be. Doing things in pairs / groups Making sure everyone is on the same page before starting work Documentation *so choices can be rolled back/remade if necessary Be soft with sudo Working slowly, doing things in steps, not rushing through, stopping at a step rather than getting half way through something. double check what you are about to do before doing it, as may be irreversible * Talk Consider institutional implications for managed machines Keep everyone up to date. <br>Here we logged into the server through <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell\" target=\"_self\">SSH</a> and questioned the metaphor and figure it brings of a handshake. When creating metaphors mention what is being replaced\nHere we approached the \"sudo\" command (means super user do), which enables admin rights on a system and for you to undertake maintenance. Here we imagined how we desired to configure these processes and rights.When sudo we should take extra care to make sure what we are doing is wanted by all. Work in pairs (if you can)? For any major changes at least... Should we be anonyms sudo? Or su user to trackShould sudo be used alone? Here we set up the users for the server, but also took time to manifest the figures we imagined being on this server. Here questioning the norms of user/server and individualized relations and how we want to enact them together otherwise.Not users but:maintainers?carers?Member?Players?Collaborators and caretakersit is nice to be individuals in a collectivecharactersConversationalistspersonaInfra as another collaborator not users/usingFistulas Here we uploaded SSH keys for those accounts and then closed password access to the server. This in norms makes the server \"sercure\", we took up this to imagine what safety means for us instead of security.Is transparency safety? No single point of failure/hidden information or is it helpful not to be able to delete something.Understanding the risks and making decisions based on understandingNot having knowledge lie with one personEveryone should have ability to access knowledgeDon't make ring-fence around particular rolesHow do we make people feel unafraid of making changesBut at the same time aware of what the \"risks\" areIs it more about learning how to move with caution and careThe idea is not to move fast / gung-ho / \"trigger happy\", but rather checking and double checking before doingHow can we do things like check a process before doing something, I'm thinking of Nginx command to check if the config file is valid before restarting the server... can we try to research that for all software we use? If we end up making our own tools, can we build caution / testing / care into our procedures, so that people feel confident that the changes they are about to make are safe to do? Demystifying what is safe protocols etc. Boundaries are helpful between the server and outside the serverHere we logged into TMUX an SSH multiplexer (basically a way to collaborate on server work). We wanted to imagine what collaborative relations we desired, but got caught up on TMUX technicalities. . . Turns out that typing exit in a string seems to exit it also Nominate who will type, and check in when people are getting tired. Take turns, maybe signal end of a string/phrase? Over, fin, out! fnx your turn bbzHere we turned our attention from (con)figuring out the server to manifesting how we wanted to serve In-grid. Here we started by returning to the original Feminist Server Manifesto, and reading it line by line together, each member taking it in turns, but also doing this no deterministically and one taking after where the other left off. We also chatted about our relations to it and how it had influenced us in our work and lives. Here we then took space to do a sedimented In-grid practice of free writing to enable all members to anonymously (+ without anxiety) and collectively form our own lines for a manifesto.New things: Balance between caution/testing/care and empowerment\nDoes not police language, but reads intentions and actionsForm different relations of access around both technology, critical thought and crip access.Enable us to practice and perform new relations of radical politics that we need now!Is not another cage to hold things in, or protect us from.

Does not police language, but reads intentions and actionsUnderstanding that there is often no one route to the ideals(?) we are trying to embrace but that there are thorny implications and 'seamfull' histories to navigate Transparent about power and how it's being usedNotes: Opens herself to expose processes, tools, sources, habits, patterns (Katie was talking about this as transparency / accessibility) Does not strive for seamlessness. Talk of transparency too often signals that something is being made invisible (what is the relationship between seamlessness and transparency) Seamlessness require a lot of labour and obscure the effort behind the scenes.By making knowledge of a system or the system itself accessible, we don't need to make the system seamless? What is the difference between accessibility and transparency? Accessibility of sudoWe then took the original server manifesto's lines and started to align our own with them, figuring out how we oriented in different ways.A Festering Server is . . . . . a 10 minute manifesto\nIs a situated technology.

This is where we have made room within and around these hard network infrastructures with and for our softer practices of collective access.

These docs explain how to setup the back-end VPN and server infrastructure that can then host services like the wiki4print instance we have installed there.For this research these docs are important as they are a place where I brought in critical access into our collective practice with the work of Kelsie Acton's Plain Language For Disability. Here I share the:\n<br><a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"entries/Docs00 Contents - wiki4print.md\" href=\"08_practice/03_in-grid/in-docs/entries/docs00-contents-wiki4print.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Docs00 Contents - wiki4print</a> main page local demo.\nReflectionThese docs were very much our collective first attempt at writing technical docs, as well as doing accessible plain language writing and so I do think they could be improved in a number of ways. One of these ways is to have consulted a plain language author, instead of just referencing their work. The limitations we had on budget, time and capacity oriented us to be able to just be informed by instead of in contact with, but I feel it was a good place to start this dialogue within our collective practice and an orientation to move towards in the future.In-Docs<br>These are the workshops that I organised with In-grid members and reflect on in the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.02.00_Configure-ability_In-Workshops</a> entries. In these workshops we set up our VPS server with Servus, as an experimental server for us to test and explore some different network infrastructure projects. In the workshop we made space for us to figure out how we wanted to imagine and enact our infrastructure as we made it.

page brings together cozy intentions for the cozy-cloud crip (disability justice) space. This is to give an understanding of how * why this crip centred platform came to be and to share some of the desires we have when making an affirmative digital space that centres disabled people.These intentions appear as image and alt text pairs, each defining its own thread to be followed, weaving together a story or figuring of the cozy-cloud. In a classic crip move, they entangle together the affective feelings of our mind body and their knowledges, within an understanding of political relational modelling to imagine new ways to transform our social * technical infrastructures.&nbsp;Simply put these intentions mean to affirm what we feel as disabled people in both our bodies and minds, and to enable those knowledges at the centre of transforming digital communication networks and systems like social media platforms. maybe something about enviro x materialThese intentions ask: If we as disabled neurodiverse chronically ill people are able to transform digital spaces and communities and their material infrastructure (+ the environmental effects they have) from a space of crip care and time, what could that look like and feel like?If you are a member of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">cozy-cloud</a> platform and want to add to or tweak these intentions and you have not had the opportunity yet please message <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/u/COZY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/u/COZY\" target=\"_self\">COZY</a> for the etherpad they are edited on.<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/lets-get-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">Furry text saying \"Let's Get Cozy\", welcomes you to get cozy! This is an enthusiastic and loving message reminding you to get cozy in what ever way you are able to.Many times (not always) when we can't get cozy,our experience it is telling us that something might be wrong systemically. This text asks us to think, what would enable me to get cozy? What relations would have to change for us to actually be cozy? By trying to get cozy we start to make these transformations, so settle in and lets get cozy.<br><img src=\"my-projects-🗃/cozy-cloud/previs/imgs/cloud5.png\" target=\"_self\">A cloud sits unsure on a day with mixed weather. It feels sensitive to the gusts and gales of bigger clouds and so searches for a sheltered valley to get cozy and come back to earth. It asks us to think about how we feel in the cloud. When we are using cloud enabled devices, like streaming, cloud drives or social platforms do we feel a connection to what it is we are doing? What would it feel like to ground and get cozy with our digital infrastructures.<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/less-clouds-more-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">The cozy-cloud sits within a ring of furry and cozy text saying \"Less Cloud - More Cozy\". It feels warmth in knowing its energies are conserved for doing cozy things and not being a part of deadly storms elsewhere. It asks us to think about less dispersion of our digital selves into a commercial cloud that displaces the harms of digital infrastructures out of sight. How can we settle in, keep ourselves close and feel out how cozy our clouds could be?<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/infinite-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">Slightly clumsy but cute furry text says \"Clouds are finite :( Coziness can be infinite!\". It sits slightly slumped to one side, exhausted with keeping up with the continuous expansion. It helps us to reflect on the limitations of computing and cloud infrastructures, the consumption of fossil fuels, rare minerals and people's labour to try to maintain the unmaintainable infinite growth. What if we centre our clouds on other infinities of care, compassion and coziness? What would infrastructures feel like and be able of through these gentler modes?<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/cozy-networks_bg.png\" target=\"_self\">A map of arpnet, the first computer network produced by the us gov/army is transformed into a cozy-constellation. This transformation resembles the way digital networks have a history of control of space (both physical and virtual) through force and how we have to transform them with care and coziness.It asks us how we could imagine networks away from these histories of mapping, taxonomy and creating specific ways of knowing/doing? Instead can we imagine it as a set of unknowable stars, a relation of gravitates to be felt but unknown felt from afar? <br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/a-cloud.png\" target=\"_self\">A png of a cloud with transparent background so that it looks like it is comfortable and confident wherever it is displayed. The cloud looks so light and pretty floating on the page, but still on the edge of creating a little drizzle. The image itself is also on a free license so is free like a cloud!It reminds us what a cloud looks like and what it is able of. The computational infrastructures that make up the commercial cloud could never be so light nor caring to our ecology nor our body/minds. What metaphors or analogies would you give the cloud? How would you transform them through putting this digital infrastructure in your own terms.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Let's Get Cozy","level":2,"id":"Let's_Get_Cozy_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_0"},{"heading":"A Cozy Looking Cloud","level":2,"id":"A_Cozy_Looking_Cloud_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_1"},{"heading":"Less Cloud More Cozy","level":2,"id":"Less_Cloud_More_Cozy_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_2"},{"heading":"Clouds are finite :( Coziness can be infinite","level":2,"id":"Clouds_are_finite_(_Coziness_can_be_infinite_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_3"},{"heading":"Transform networks of control 2 constellations of care","level":2,"id":"Transform_networks_of_control_2_constellations_of_care_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_4"},{"heading":"This is a cloud","level":2,"id":"This_is_a_cloud_0"},{"heading":"alt-text:","level":3,"id":"alt-text_5"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/cozy-intentions.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/lets-get-cozy.html","my-projects-🗃/cozy-cloud/previs/imgs/cloud5.png","08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/less-clouds-more-cozy.html","08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/infinite-cozy.html","08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/cozy-networks_bg.html","08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/a-cloud.html"],"createdTime":1756048613424,"modifiedTime":1756048613424,"sourceSize":5257,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy-Intentions/Cozy-Intentions.md","exportPath":"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/cozy-intentions.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/media/interface-of-cozy-ish-theme.html":{"title":"interface of Cozy-ish theme","icon":"","description":"<img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/media/interface-of-cozy-ish-theme.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/media/interface-of-cozy-ish-theme.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/media/interface-of-cozy-ish-theme.html"],"createdTime":1756048613640,"modifiedTime":1756048613644,"sourceSize":123620,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/08_Practice/08_Cozy-Cloud/Cozy-ish/media/interface of Cozy-ish theme.png","exportPath":"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/media/interface-of-cozy-ish-theme.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-ish/cozy-ish.html":{"title":"Cozy-ish","icon":"","description":"Cozy-ish is the first theme for the Cozy-Cloud blog which ran on a <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://picocms.org/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://picocms.org/\" target=\"_self\">Pico CMS</a>.

This is to give an understanding of how * why this crip centred platform came to be and to share some of the desires we have when making an affirmative digital space that centres disabled people.These intentions appear as image and alt text pairs, each defining its own thread to be followed, weaving together a story or figuring of the cozy-cloud. In a classic crip move, they entangle together the affective feelings of our mind body and their knowledges, within an understanding of political relational modelling to imagine new ways to transform our social * technical infrastructures.&nbsp;Simply put these intentions mean to affirm what we feel as disabled people in both our bodies and minds, and to enable those knowledges at the centre of transforming digital communication networks and systems like social media platforms. maybe something about enviro x materialThese intentions ask: If we as disabled neurodiverse chronically ill people are able to transform digital spaces and communities and their material infrastructure (+ the environmental effects they have) from a space of crip care and time, what could that look like and feel like?<br>If you are a member of the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/\" target=\"_self\">cozy-cloud</a> platform and want to add to or tweak these intentions and you have not had the opportunity yet please message <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/u/COZY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://care.cozy-cloud.net/u/COZY\" target=\"_self\">COZY</a> for the etherpad they are edited on.<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/lets-get-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">Furry text saying \"Let's Get Cozy\", welcomes you to get cozy! This is an enthusiastic and loving message reminding you to get cozy in what ever way you are able to.Many times (not always) when we can't get cozy,our experience it is telling us that something might be wrong systemically. This text asks us to think, what would enable me to get cozy? What relations would have to change for us to actually be cozy? By trying to get cozy we start to make these transformations, so settle in and lets get cozy.<br><img src=\"my-projects-🗃/cozy-cloud/previs/imgs/cloud5.png\" target=\"_self\">A cloud sits unsure on a day with mixed weather. It feels sensitive to the gusts and gales of bigger clouds and so searches for a sheltered valley to get cozy and come back to earth. It asks us to think about how we feel in the cloud. When we are using cloud enabled devices, like streaming, cloud drives or social platforms do we feel a connection to what it is we are doing? What would it feel like to ground and get cozy with our digital infrastructures.<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/less-clouds-more-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">The cozy-cloud sits within a ring of furry and cozy text saying \"Less Cloud - More Cozy\". It feels warmth in knowing its energies are conserved for doing cozy things and not being a part of deadly storms elsewhere. It asks us to think about less dispersion of our digital selves into a commercial cloud that displaces the harms of digital infrastructures out of sight. How can we settle in, keep ourselves close and feel out how cozy our clouds could be?<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/infinite-cozy.png\" target=\"_self\">Slightly clumsy but cute furry text says \"Clouds are finite :( Coziness can be infinite!\". It sits slightly slumped to one side, exhausted with keeping up with the continuous expansion. It helps us to reflect on the limitations of computing and cloud infrastructures, the consumption of fossil fuels, rare minerals and people's labour to try to maintain the unmaintainable infinite growth. What if we centre our clouds on other infinities of care, compassion and coziness? What would infrastructures feel like and be able of through these gentler modes?<br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/cozy-networks_bg.png\" target=\"_self\">A map of arpnet, the first computer network produced by the us gov/army is transformed into a cozy-constellation. This transformation resembles the way digital networks have a history of control of space (both physical and virtual) through force and how we have to transform them with care and coziness.It asks us how we could imagine networks away from these histories of mapping, taxonomy and creating specific ways of knowing/doing? Instead can we imagine it as a set of unknowable stars, a relation of gravitates to be felt but unknown felt from afar? <br><img src=\"08_practice/08_cozy-cloud/cozy-intentions/media/a-cloud.png\" target=\"_self\">A png of a cloud with transparent background so that it looks like it is comfortable and confident wherever it is displayed. The cloud looks so light and pretty floating on the page, but still on the edge of creating a little drizzle. The image itself is also on a free license so is free like a cloud!It reminds us what a cloud looks like and what it is able of. The computational infrastructures that make up the commercial cloud could never be so light nor caring to our ecology nor our body/minds. What metaphors or analogies would you give the cloud?

With them I coalesce together the many tables this researcher has been present at, sharing the frictions felt, impacts made and collective configurations manifested.

Here bringing from my research's crip background, I form a critique of Configuration in STS, and in it I make room for critical access informed impact centred approaches to community configuration. This initial orienting of Configure-Able Methods is also informed through a reflection on collective access for a workshop I organised for NEoN digital called Configure-Able Infrastructures. Through this inquiry into access knowledge I worked with the dispersed expertise of collaborators and participants to improvise, configure out and orient towards accessible Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). In this orientation making sense of the impacts, frictions and restraints I felt, both from the sedimented institution norms of computing and academia, but from these making space to figure out how to orient them towards access and affirmation.

In this inquiry with In-grid members we disoriented our organisational infrastructures and practices by making room for us to feel out our collective bodily horizon and how we wanted to orient ourselves outside of the inflexible sedimented and restrictive norms. In a focus group I talk about in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a>, we collectively reflected on how this had happened through our banking and internal politics, questioning where we felt impacted by sedimented systemic inflexibilities, and in doing so forming space tom imagine and enact ways to orient towards how we collectivley are within these relations. Through <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-.md\" href=\"06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.00_configure-ability_in-.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-</a> I also reflect on a closer on a long term inquiry around how we came into contact with network infrastructuring practices, orienting them through collective access and building up our capacities to share their technical skills and dialogues, but also make them more disputable by different expertise. From these practices emerged the Practicing Protocols workshop through hich we emerged our own counter figures and roles of these network infrastructures, moving from the determined limits of \"users\" and \"servers\", to make room for our own divergent roles of carer, maintainer, character, collaborator and/or persona. In this wiggle room making flexibility for our collective roles/relations, embodied knowledges, and expertise to emerge from our backgrounds and make impact on hard systems. Through these iterations and situated contexts of Configure-Able methods with In-grid, it made room for us to interdependently feel out and action how we wanted to reconfigure our approaches to organisation, server infrastructures, and collective maintenance.<br>Through the collaboration of the Cozy-Cloud these Configure-Able methods have surfaced, of course, through the manifesting of this cripped server, but also through the specific works that I have shared. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> this oriented making intentions for this server through design frictions. In this both making room within stickers for access alt texts (which they lacked), but also for Alt Texts to make room for wider relational critiques of network access and the sediment ableist norms of these infrastructures and their imaginaries. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time</a> I also reflect on the first collaboration with the Cozy-Cloud with Marianna Marangoni. Here we made room together to disorient and crip the computational clock and the social relations of the server we had inherited. Here figuring crip types of variability towards infrastructures through poetic chronic jobs that shared crip times through intimate protocols. These inquiries as well as the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.04_Futures_x_Desires.md\" href=\"07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.04_futures_x_desires.html#_0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.04_Futures_x_Desires</a> of the Cozy-Cloud making room for crips to figure out through critical access in action, what a life affirming network infrastructure might be.These inquiries give shape to the capacity for wiggle room that Configure-Able methods can manifest within and around the inherited norms of our communities social and technical infrastructures. Through this research Configure-Able methods has emerged within these situated collaborations as a generative methodology to disorient the narrative, roles and configurations that have been normalised within our network infrastructures by bringing our collective bodily horizon in touch with them, but more importantly impact on them. This was done by making room to validate the sense making and frictions that different collaborations felt when accessing these technologies together. Within this room for friction also forming from them counter figures and configurations that orient from our collective backgrounds and embodied knowing that aim to disorient these systems with our locality. These methods of course are still in practice, and I am excited to be writing this up and reflecting on how they have emerged differently within each context they have been manifested at.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Reflecting On Configure-Able Methods","level":2,"id":"Reflecting_On_Configure-Able_Methods_0"}],"links":["05_configure-able_methods/05_configure-able_methods.html#_0","05_configure-able_methods/05_entries/05.02.02_cripping-configuration.html#_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_in-configure-ability.html#_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.02.00_processing-in-configure-ability.html#_0","06_in-configure-ability/06_entries/06.03.00_configure-ability_in-.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.02.00_cozy_intentions.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time.html#_0","07_a_cozier_configure-able_methods/07_entries/07.04_futures_x_desires.html#_0"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"09_conclusion/09_entries/09.01_reflecting_on_configure-able_methods.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756048613712,"modifiedTime":1756048613713,"sourceSize":6059,"sourcePath":"Thesis/Repo/09_Conclusion/09_entries/09.01_Reflecting_On_Configure-Able_Methods.md","exportPath":"09_conclusion/09_entries/09.01_reflecting_on_configure-able_methods.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"09_conclusion/09_entries/09.02_configure-able_futures.html":{"title":"09.02_Configure-Able_Futures","icon":"","description":"This reflection also brings with it the capacity for me within this research to think forward to the futures this methodology is already unfolding within my own reach, no matter if it gets taken up by others.Within In-grid we have already started to care for the friction and deprication of Tinc VPN, starting to configure out together own use of Wireguard virtual private network (VPN).

In doing this we have made wiggle room for crip and critical access informed practices within inflexible centralised configuration practices and methods so that they can be manifest and reverberate from the sites of impact, and by the people they are in touch with.09.00_IntroIn <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_Configure-Able_Methods.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05_Configure-Able_Methods</a> I form an outline through theory and action of what Configure-Able Methods are. Here bringing from my research's crip background, I form a critique of Configuration in STS, and in it I make room for critical access informed impact centred approaches to community configuration. This initial orienting of Configure-Able Methods is also informed through a reflection on collective access for a workshop I organised for NEoN digital called Configure-Able Infrastructures. Through this inquiry into access knowledge I worked with the dispersed expertise of collaborators and participants to improvise, configure out and orient towards accessible Free Libre Open-Source Software (FLOSS). In this orientation making sense of the impacts, frictions and restraints I felt, both from the sedimented institution norms of computing and academia, but from these making space to figure out how to orient them towards access and affirmation. This chapter results in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../05_Configure-Able_Methods/05_entries/05.02.02_Cripping Configuration.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.02.02_Cripping Configuration</a> to make room for these Configure-Able Methods to emerge as impact centred, critical access informed community infrastructuring methods that aim to make wiggle room for flexible messy localities within inflexible systems.<br>In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_In-Configure-Ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06_In-Configure-Ability</a> I undertook an intersectional collaboration with In-grid where these Configure-Able methods have made room for us to orient from critical access, instead of having it as extra time. In this inquiry with In-grid members we disoriented our organisational infrastructures and practices by making room for us to feel out our collective bodily horizon and how we wanted to orient ourselves outside of the inflexible sedimented and restrictive norms. In a focus group I talk about in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.02.00_Processing In-Configure-ability</a>, we collectively reflected on how this had happened through our banking and internal politics, questioning where we felt impacted by sedimented systemic inflexibilities, and in doing so forming space tom imagine and enact ways to orient towards how we collectivley are within these relations. Through <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../06_In-Configure-Ability/06_entries/06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">06.03.00_Configure-ability_In-</a> I also reflect on a closer on a long term inquiry around how we came into contact with network infrastructuring practices, orienting them through collective access and building up our capacities to share their technical skills and dialogues, but also make them more disputable by different expertise. From these practices emerged the Practicing Protocols workshop through hich we emerged our own counter figures and roles of these network infrastructures, moving from the determined limits of \"users\" and \"servers\", to make room for our own divergent roles of carer, maintainer, character, collaborator and/or persona. In this wiggle room making flexibility for our collective roles/relations, embodied knowledges, and expertise to emerge from our backgrounds and make impact on hard systems. Through these iterations and situated contexts of Configure-Able methods with In-grid, it made room for us to interdependently feel out and action how we wanted to reconfigure our approaches to organisation, server infrastructures, and collective maintenance.<br>Through the collaboration of the Cozy-Cloud these Configure-Able methods have surfaced, of course, through the manifesting of this cripped server, but also through the specific works that I have shared. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.02.00_Cozy_Intentions</a> this oriented making intentions for this server through design frictions. In this both making room within stickers for access alt texts (which they lacked), but also for Alt Texts to make room for wider relational critiques of network access and the sediment ableist norms of these infrastructures and their imaginaries. In <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.03.01_en-crip-ing_time</a> I also reflect on the first collaboration with the Cozy-Cloud with Marianna Marangoni. Here we made room together to disorient and crip the computational clock and the social relations of the server we had inherited. Here figuring crip types of variability towards infrastructures through poetic chronic jobs that shared crip times through intimate protocols. These inquiries as well as the <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../07_A_Cozier_Configure-Able_Methods/07_entries/07.04_Futures_x_Desires.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">07.04_Futures_x_Desires</a> of the Cozy-Cloud making room for crips to figure out through critical access in action, what a life affirming network infrastructure might be.These inquiries give shape to the capacity for wiggle room that Configure-Able methods can manifest within and around the inherited norms of our communities social and technical infrastructures. Through this research Configure-Able methods has emerged within these situated collaborations as a generative methodology to disorient the narrative, roles and configurations that have been normalised within our network infrastructures by bringing our collective bodily horizon in touch with them, but more importantly impact on them. This was done by making room to validate the sense making and frictions that different collaborations felt when accessing these technologies together. Within this room for friction also forming from them counter figures and configurations that orient from our collective backgrounds and embodied knowing that aim to disorient these systems with our locality. These methods of course are still in practice, and I am excited to be writing this up and reflecting on how they have emerged differently within each context they have been manifested at.09.01_Reflecting_On_Configure-Able_Methods07_A Cozier Configure-ability_canvas.canvas06_In-Configure-Ability_canvas.canvasThis reflection also brings with it the capacity for me within this research to think forward to the futures this methodology is already unfolding within my own reach, no matter if it gets taken up by others.<br>Within In-grid we have already started to care for the friction and deprication of Tinc VPN, starting to configure out together own use of Wireguard virtual private network (VPN). In this we are also already carrying on this Configure-Able methods of questioning the frictions we feel as we come into contact with WireGaurd and get to know it. This includes things like the naming of Wireguard, as again conflating privacy with security politics like I discuss in <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../05_In-Configure-Ability/05_entries/05.03.01.02.02_In-Practice.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">05.03.01.02.02_In-Practice</a>, as well as the ways it orients figures of efficiency and accessibility towards infinite growth. Here Configure-Able methods has made room for us to stay with the trouble of WireGaurd, but in doing so configuring out our own imaginary of VPNs and private/safe network infrastructures and practices.<br>With NEoN Digital and their community partners, In-grid and I have been invited to practice these Configure-Able methods with them to manifest a community server funded by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO)<a data-footref=\"91\" href=\"09_conclusion/09_conclusion_canvas.html#fn-1-5da346faa90fed9e_0\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> infrastructural funds. This project is just beginning but it will be interesting to practice these methods with a community that may be newer or bring more diverse backgrounds, expertise and knowing to these infrastructuring tables and what generative frictions they may make sense of. Entering into this project In-grid is also starting to formulate and configure more accountable organisational practices, thinking back to the advice form Healing Justice London (HJL) I reflect on at <a class=\"internal-link\" data-href=\"../../03_Crip-Tic_of_Vignettes/03_entries/03.04_The_crip_table.md\" href=\".html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">03.04_The_crip_table</a>. In this again orienting to make knowable and accessible the organisational structures and power relations within these working groups so that they may be more easily be disputed, rather than reinforced.Within the Cozy-Cloud this collaboration is still very much in emergence and slowly becoming a pivoting point for more crip people to orient from and wiggle room on networks for us together. I have been gently building up this collaboration through inviting some more collaborators to be involved. In inviting people in taking our sweet crip ass time to be intimate and emerge Cozy relations to maintain this crip social and technical network infrastructures. Some of the more recent actions have been figuring out the protocols we need to communicate as well as the disobedient efficiencies we need to make room for us to have capacity to be together around/within institutional limits. <br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://scvo.scot/\" target=\"_self\">https://scvo.scot/</a><a href=\"09_conclusion/09_conclusion_canvas.html#fnref-1-5da346faa90fed9e_0\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n09.02_Configure-Able_FuturesBeyond these different tables that I am moving towards, I hope these Configure-Able methods are generative for other to be taken up and manifest by them in their own contexts and through this hopefully troubling and disorienting them too. By troubling I aim not for this to be a final or cure of a methodology, but for it to be methodology to be iterated like Alison Kafer's faulty crazed manifesto (2023), or the Feminist Server Manifesto (2015) that are central to this research.

This is all held together within a knowledge base made with obsidian. I decided to take this approach to the portfolio as I was reflecting on conversations with Creative Crowds (CC) around the Servpub project, and how they brought to the foreground the practices of their publishing process. Here taking a similar orientation I wanted to bring to the foreground my writing practice and approach to collating together thoughts and writings. These are especially important within this crip research, offering up the ways dyslexic and neurodivergent people can shape and hack their own knowledge making practices. This crip research practice has taken on a lot of configuring thoughts and practices through diagrams and what are called canvases in obsidian. By offering this up I share how this practice has shaped this research and how it has made room for me to bring together my different inquiries.Mobiles!?!?!\nThe canvases are not very mobile friendly, so I would recommend checking it out on desktop for now. Thesis canvasThis is a canvas that holds all of the chapters and practice together in one graph.
